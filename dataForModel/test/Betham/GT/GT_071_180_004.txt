44COf Frauds relative to the Coin.at first sight that where a man counterfeits foreign Coin, the loss is not to his own country, but to that to which the Coin pur= :ports to belong. but this is not necessarily the case. The loss is even more likely to fall upon the people of his own country, than upon any person abroad .
