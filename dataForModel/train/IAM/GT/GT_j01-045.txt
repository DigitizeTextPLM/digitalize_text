Thus for the specific case of niobium in a sodium circuit a corrosion indicator couldbe a reference electrode of sodium saturated and equilibrated with niobium sepa-rated from the coolant by a solid anionic electrolyte. A negative voltage from thereference electrode would mean oxidizing conditions for niobium and positive volt-age, non-oxidizing conditions. The practical application of the above idea will involveconsiderable experimentation before it can be realised.
