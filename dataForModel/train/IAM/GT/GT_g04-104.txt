In those early years 1914-18, life was very full both in the parish and in the wider waractivities. The Bishop, knowing that I spent my holidays in Bavaria, asked me if Iwould do something for two wards at the Royal Herbert Hospital, full of war prisoners.I was very glad to help in this way, and visited them frequently, establishing at once afriendly contact with the Bavarian wounded who were delighted to find someone whoknew their native villages.
