It is the tendency to get things the wrong way round. As a psychologist I am con-stantly encountering this tendency in friends and acquaintances. They think there issomething inevitably &quot;queer&quot; about psychology and this feeling of queerness usuallyboils down to a quite mistaken belief that the psychologist first looks into his ownmind and then interprets other people's minds by what he has found in his own.
