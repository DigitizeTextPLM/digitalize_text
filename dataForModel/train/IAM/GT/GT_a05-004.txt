Short of wearing the same uniform, which is not contemplated, the Navy, Army andRoyal Air Force would become, for practical purposes, a single defence force. Therewould be complete co-operation at all levels in training and operations. This wouldapply also in the command structure and central administrative organisation. Mr.Watkinson, Minister of Defence, has been working on the plan for some months, withthe Prime Minister's approval.
