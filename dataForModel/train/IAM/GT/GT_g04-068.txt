Meanwhile in Purley there was much activity and much co-operation especially withthe other Christian communities. At a large public meeting we launched the projectknown as the 'Coulsdon and Purley Patriotic Fund' in whose counsels and committeesI found myself deeply involved. At first, the main work was to help wives and relationsof the soldiers to get their 'Separation' allowances, but soon, alas!, as casualties beganand increased in the winter of 1914 and 1915 the matter of War Pensions became veryurgent, and I was asked to be Chairman of the Committee in Coulsdon and Purley.
