Loeb first suggested the importance of light as the governing factor but combinedits influence with that of gravity. Later authors, in particular Rose, have proposedthat light alone can provide an adequate mechanism if the animals have, and selectby exploration, a zone of optimum light intensity. This view has been enlarged witha suggestion that both phototaxes and geotaxes may play a part in keeping animalsnear their optimum.
