In appreciating this story, modern conceptions of governmental duties must be setaside. A modern government needs taxation not merely for defence and offence butfor a very wide range of social services. A mediaeval oligarchy needed taxation inorder to supplement the private wealth of the monarchy (the royal income from therevenues of crown lands, the fees of feudalism and the fines of justice) and to provideenough cash to meet royal expenses, and especially the expenses of waging war.
