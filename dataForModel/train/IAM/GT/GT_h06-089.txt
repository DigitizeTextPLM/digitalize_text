The lower platen, which supports the leather, is raised hydraulically to bring it intocontact with the rollers on the upper platen, which is then caused to make severalhorizontal oscillations so that the leather is rolled and pressed at the same time. Thedanger zone between the platens is fenced by a guard which is interlocked with thehydraulic valve and the press is also sequentially operated: the closing of the shutterstarts the machine, the rest of the cycle following automatically.
