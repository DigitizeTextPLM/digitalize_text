The production by Bill Duncalf compressed a long and sometimes rambling storyinto a concentrated comprehensive survey of a life work. P. J. K. HANS WERNERHENZE'S &quot;Elegy for Young Lovers&quot; is the first unambiguously &quot;contemporary&quot; workto be admitted to the Glyndebourne canon. By no means a masterpiece, it is inmany respects a representative modern work and the composer is a highly skilledmanipulator of contemporary idioms, with a strong sense of words and situation.
