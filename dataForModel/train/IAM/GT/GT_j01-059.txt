Provided the temperatures at C and E are the same, thermoelectric contributions tothe voltage should be zero. The probe extends out of the sodium stream through aclose fitting thin walled T-Junction F and passes into the open via a water-cooled Oring seal G. The open end of the probe is sealed with a vacuum coupling H which alsopositions the +ve nickel conductor with respect to the sodium by circlips on eitherside of the seal I.
