Speaking of churchwardens and children leads me at once to chronicle a most intimateand lasting friendship begun in 1913 in Purley and continuing till old age to-day. WhenI went to St. Mark's, the first contact I made was with the Vicar's Warden, Mr. F.W. Charlton and his family, the youngest of whose three sons was just coming intothe world in this year of 1913.
