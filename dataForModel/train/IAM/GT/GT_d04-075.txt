The Messusah, which is nailed on the doorposts contains those two lessons. Thethird lesson of the Shmah (Numbers 15, 37-41) is called &quot;the going-out of the land ofEgypt&quot;. It starts with the story of the fringes the &quot;tsitsits&quot;. This lesson used to beread only in the morning. And the Talmud tells a story, which is also in the Hagadahthat Rabbi Eleasar ben Assarja said, &quot;I am nearly seventy and I had not succeeded that people should read 'the going out of Egypt' the passage Numbers 15, 37-41, bynight&quot;, because the fringes (tsitsits) are only used in the day; till Ben Zoma cameand explained the verse (Deut. 16, 3) &quot;that 1thou 1mayest remember the day when1thou 1camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of 1thy life.&quot;
