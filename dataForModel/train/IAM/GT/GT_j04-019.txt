The ingrowth of bismuth-210 was followed for ten days and showed no abnormalities.Any impurity in the lead fraction must have been well below one percent. Someseparated lead-210 was used to make reference standards and as a tracer in recoveryexperiments. There was no significant difference between these results and thoseobtained using the original lead-210 solution supplied by the Radiochemical Centrewhich we concluded was radiochemically pure.
