Ministers hadrebuked the unaligned nations for not condemning the new Russian tests, but theythemselves had no condemnation for events in Angola or Algeria. It was not for theGovernment, said Mr. Healey, to take up moral attitudes, &quot;especially when the templeof their religion is the bingo-parlour.&quot;
