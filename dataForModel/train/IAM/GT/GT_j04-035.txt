Absorption of the beta particles is also kept to a minimum but the accuracy andprecision of weighing the precipitated sources suffers. All precipitates were weighedon a semi-micro balance which had been calibrated with a set of certificated weightsfrom the National Physical Laboratory. Complete chemical exchange between theradio-lead and the added lead carrier is necessary if the analytical results are to becorrect.
