In the first place it is not a great deal of use telling even children, as I have alreadysuggested, not to be silly or to pull themselves together. Far better to help them toface whatever it is that is worrying them, to find the original cause and then deal withit; show it up either for the sham it is - and many fears are based upon completelyirrational pre-conceived notions - or to show how we may deal with it so as to removethe power to torment us that it seems to possess.
