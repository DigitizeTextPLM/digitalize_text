Who will speak up for Belgium? Who else but Britain. We have fought besideBelgium in two world wars. We are allies still. Britain should champion Belgium.Not with the careful, hooded language of diplomacy, but boldly and fearlessly. It istime to show the world that this country does not desert her friends. HAPPY, happyfamilies! Never before have Britain's larders been so well stocked.
