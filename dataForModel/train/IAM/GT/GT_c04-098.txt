But not one of his nimble-fingered best. GERMANY'S Russ Conway is a pianistwho calls himself CRAZY OTTO. But nothing crazy about his pianistics. He poundsmerrily away at a piece called "Piccadilly" (Polydor). I find it cute. American pianistFloyd Cramer, who played for Elvis on "It's Now or Never," looks like having a successon his own with "On the Rebound" (RCA).
