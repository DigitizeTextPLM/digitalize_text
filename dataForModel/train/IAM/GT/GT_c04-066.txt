HOW do you get on records? Well, you've got to have something different. Singslightly flat. All the good singers sing in tune. Twang a guitar slightly off key.Everybody's fed up with the right way - so the best-seller charts say. Play an OLD2pianna instead of a new one. You got to get it into your head, son... people don'tlike things as they should be - not on record, anyway.
