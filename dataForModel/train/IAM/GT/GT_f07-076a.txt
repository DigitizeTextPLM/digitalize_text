The Czechoslovak kitchen, again, is so languorous, so passionate, and possibly com-parable alone to a gypsy melody. The paprika and caraway perfume the meats withtheir antithesis. The opulent varieties of Czechoslovak pastries recall in fact the richheritage of rich embroideries and costumes specifically national. The art and scienceof cookery, however, is essentially French, and, irrespective of the fact that I havenever run across anyone in Gaul who has been a glutton, I can positively say that ithas been equally difficult to find one who has not been an epicure.
