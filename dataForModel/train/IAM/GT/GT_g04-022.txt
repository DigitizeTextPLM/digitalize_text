After the First World War, 1914, I did not visit Germany for ten years, by which timein 1924 I was in a different parish in Surrey. Towards the end of my five and a halfyears' incumbency I was asked if I would start a village choral society and conduct it.This opened up a new interest, and we plunged into it.
