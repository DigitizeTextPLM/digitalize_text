In his first Hollywood picture, &quot;Let's Make Love,&quot; he was swamped by the know-howof Marilyn Monroe and Yves Montand. Against this couple Frankie, in a cardboardrole, didn't stand a chance. Now comes &quot;The Right Approach&quot; (Rialto, &quot;A&quot;), andit's a glum business. He plays an aspiring actor - a selfish, arrogant, brash, ambi-tious, unscrupulous heel - who would tread on anybody's neck to get a break in theHollywood ratrace.
