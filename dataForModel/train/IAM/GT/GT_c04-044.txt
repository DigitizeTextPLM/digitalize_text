This plot to rob a French millionaire of 300,000 worth of jewellery struck me asingenious. The play had style, moved at a quick pace and everyone did well. But it wasMr. Houston's evening.

It was also a mistake to re-book GeneDetroy and his performing chimpanzees so soon after their previous appearance.
