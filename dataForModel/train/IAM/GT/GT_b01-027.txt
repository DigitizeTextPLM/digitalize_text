THE Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh come home tonight from their tour in the East.The duke's trigger-finger and the ritual slaughter of beasts have taken the headlinesin this country. Nevertheless, the tour has been an immense success. The Queen haswon a triumph. It would be pleasanter if such cruel and feudal performances as tigerand rhino hunts were dropped from future Royal programmes.
