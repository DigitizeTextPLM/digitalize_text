Lastly, we suggest certain power tools and machines, the choice of which will dependpartly upon the space available in the workshop, the amount one is prepared to pay,and the type of work a man normally does. First, however, a word of advice generally.Do not buy so-called cheap tools or machines. They never are cheap in the long run.They may be inaccurate, the steel may be soft (or possibly too hard) so that the edgeeither crumbles or is brittle, or they may not be robust enough for the work theyhave to do.
