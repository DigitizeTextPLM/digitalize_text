Thus we can see that herring movements, although primarily instinctive perhaps, andcertainly helped and hindered by water flow, are also closely related to the sea-bedgeography. Geography, too, names the great fisheries that depend on them: theFladen Ground (where again most big shots are taken on the edges), the Gut, a deep-water channel to the Dogger where the herring spawn along the northern edge; agood contour map will almost define the migrations of these summer herring.
