We read, with sympathy, an advertisement in the reign of Charles 2 stating: 'Lost:a lawn 1handkercher with a broad hem laced round with fine Point lace about fourfingers broad' and among the effects left by Nell Gwyn is an unpaid bill for 'scarletsatin shoes with silver lace'. The records of these tender trifles are very touching butthen lace does place upon everything a delicate sentiment.
