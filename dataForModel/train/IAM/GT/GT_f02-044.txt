In 1959 it was suggested by Mr. T. M. Banks, Assistant Director of Education forGlasgow, that industrial firms might be ready to let older employees attend day-release courses on preparation for retirement, their wages paid for the time thusspent. An approach was made to about twenty large firms and in October, 1959, thefirst experimental day-release course for men was organised. Eleven students fromseven firms attended a course on six full Fridays and it was made clear both to the menand their employers that the venture was an experiment from which the organisershoped to learn as much as the participants.
