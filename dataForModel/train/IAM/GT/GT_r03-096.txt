Yes. I'm afraid we couldn't raise this loan to more than three thousand three fifty atthe most. Now you could get quite a nice little semi-detached house in Grimstead forthree thousand, that's where I live, just before the green belt, lovely and modern, youknow. I forgot to tell you, we don't usually lend any house built earlier than 1918.&quot;
