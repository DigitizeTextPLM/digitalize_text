Furthermore, developments in the detail form of the fins made possible a reductionin the total surface area required as compared with the use of smooth continuouspassages for the same thermal duty and pressure losses. The properties of compactform, low weight, and design flexibility thus developed found ready application on amuch larger scale with the introduction of tonnage scale air separation plants.
