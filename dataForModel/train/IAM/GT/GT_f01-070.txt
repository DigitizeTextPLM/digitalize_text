Can we now put forward any reasonably clear picture of this &quot;basis&quot; of mental phe-nomena? The physicists have succeeded remarkably well, with the atomic theory, ingiving a clear and detailed picture of the basis of such material phenomena as chem-ical action, magnetism, the behaviour of gases and so on. Where has psychology gotto in its theories of &quot;mind&quot;? Are there any ultimate units of mind akin to the atomsof matter?
