We travelled down to Nice on the Lambretta. You can free-wheel down a quarter ofthe way. In the middle of the journey is a valley with a sea of vines and olives andbeaches of earth pricked to blood by the hoe. Rising from the flecked sea are islandstapering to shipwrecked castles and towns, grey, rose-headed mariners clinging likelimpets to the rock.
