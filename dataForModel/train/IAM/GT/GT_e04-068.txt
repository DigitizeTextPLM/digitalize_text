I have also included a sketch of paddles I make for rowing this dinghy (Fig. 3). Theyare very simple, cheap and easy to make. As will be seen from the plan there is onlya single gunwale on the outside. I find that the type of rowlock we use in Canada isdifficult to obtain here and expensive. I overcome this in another way as shown inFig. 4.
