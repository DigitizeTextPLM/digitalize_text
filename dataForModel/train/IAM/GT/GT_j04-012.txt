Knowing the time of separation and the activity of the lead-210 solution, the ingrowthof the bismuth-210 can be calculated. The absolute activity of the reference standardscan be calculated from the known activity of the lead-210 solution and the chemicalyield, but this calculation is unnecessary provided the same lead carrier solution isused to prepare the reference standards and for the analyses.
