Cis the pain of sympathy. This then is aleady an evil. If it be without their consent, it assumes necessarily the shape of some one or other of the offences against the pro: :perty of individuals; it changes its nature and becomes an offence against individuals. Idleness then, when the result of choice and ac: :companied by indigence, is obviously a proper object of coercion. But is it the result of choice?

This can onlybe Of Idleness.2
