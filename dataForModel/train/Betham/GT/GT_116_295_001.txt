two non-expirees. These four fugitives were discovered by smoking the ship, an operation, for which the consent of the master (forso it is particularly stated) had been obtained. Of the non-expi--rees it is stated that they had not yet served the full periodof their sentences. From this statement it seemed reasonable toinferr that even these, had they returned to England, would nothave been landed there till after the day at which they hada right to land on British ground. Be this as it may,thus much is our doubt, that by this order the assurancegiven in the preceding one of August 1792 was compleatlyviolated: and that in respect of the faculty of leaving theColony, the condition of those who had a right, and thosewho had not a right, was the same: the same under theeye, and by the act of that very Governor, by whom the exist--ence of the right had not seven months before, been noticedand recognized so that, by his own shewing, he kept themthere in defiance of the law.N. 12 (p. 283) 24th April 1793. A second opportunity for ma--nifesting the sincerity of the assurance, and the manifestation isof the same kind. "But few Convicts" (meaning Expirees, saysCaptain Collins) "were allowed to quit the Colony in these ships:by which it is evident that it was want of permission on thepart of the governor, and not want of room or any otherfaculty that prevented the numbers from being greater. Theships were two. On another occasion in Nov. 1794 it appearsthat the number of Convicts received on board two ships only(the Endeavour and the Fancy) had been near an hundred +: whereof fifty by permission, fifty more without it.+but No75N.
