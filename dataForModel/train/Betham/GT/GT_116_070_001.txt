For"then, as he was unacquainted with the nature of them, he was"unable to suggest any remedy, he therefore desure desired that "they might be represented to him in writing; and, to spare"them as much trouble as possible, he would direct two gentle--"men on whom he had much dependance to visit the different "districts, and collect from the respective settlers such of their"distresses and grievances as they were desier desire desirous of "making known. Before they were dismissed, he gave them much "good advice; and assured them, that he had already, from his"own ideas, offered a plan to the secretary of state for their"benefit, which he hoped in due time would be attended to _ "After then, the women and children were mustered, and"were found to compose a very considerable part of the settlement." 1II Collins Extracts Supplement
