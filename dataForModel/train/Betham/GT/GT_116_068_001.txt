P.209. May 1799. "Some of the people (Natives) ever hostile to"the settlers, has lately speared one of them, a marine settler"(as those were stiled who had former formerly belonged to the "marine detachment) at George's river, so effectually, that he died"of his wounds. The natives belonged to the tribe of which"Pemulwy was the leader." Pp 281,282,283. "The natives having murdered two men who"possessed farms at the Hawkesbury, some of the settlers in that"district determined to revenge their death. There were at this"time three native boys living with one Pavel, a settler, and two"others, his neighbors. These unoffending lads they selected as the "objects of their revenge ......."The prisoners, in their defence, brought forward a crowd of"witnesses to prove that a number of white people had at"various times been killed by the natives; but, could these peo--"ple have been sufficiently understood, proofs would not have"been wanting on their side, of the wanton & barbarous manner "in which many of them had been destroyed ......."As it was impossible to explain to the natives, or cause"them to comprehend the nature of these doubts, it was to be"expected that they would ill brook the return of the prisoners"to their farms and occupations, without having received some punishment: a circumstance wholly inconsistent with their "own ideas and customs; and, indeed, they loudly threatened "to burn the crops as soon as it could be effected. Fire, in"the hands of a body of a irritated and hostile natives, "might, with but little trouble to them, ruin the prospect"of an abundant harvest; and it appeared by this threat, "that they were not ignorant of having this power in their"hands; it was, therefore, certainly very essential to the comfort "& security of the settlers in particular, that they should live "with them upon amicable terms."EconomyII Collins11
