P. 268. October 1799. "The scarcity of wheat at this time "in the public stores rendering it necessary to deduct two pounds"from the twelve which were issued, addition was made to the "weekly allowance of salt meat, eight pounds and a half of beef"being issued in lieu of five, and five pounds of port in lieu "of three. This alteration was to continue until the new crops"came in. _ "Then wearing at present a very promising app appearance,"and the various and unforeseen misfortunes which had from time "to time attended the exertions of the industrious in agriculture, "being, it was hoped, now at an end, the governor, conceiving it"to be no longer consistent with his duty to continue the original "prices of grain, directed in future that the following should be "given, viz. "For wheat, per bushel _ _ 8 shillings."For the present barley, do. _ _ 6 ditto."And for maize, do. _ _ _ 4 ditto."which prices were to commence on the first day of January "1800. "The scarcity of wheat in the public store was occasioned "by the unbounded extravagance of the labouring people, who had, "in consequence of the last unproductive season, reduced those"who supported themselves to very great distress; and several "persons, who sometime since would gladly have sent their wheat "to the store at the established price, had now refused it, when "the store was capable of receiving it; and, taking advantage of"the scarcity which they themselves had occasioned, had raised the"p price of wheat Â£1..10s per bushel; a shameful extortion!" 4
