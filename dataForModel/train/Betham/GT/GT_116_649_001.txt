Peltier's Trial p. 164 Edit 1803Mr MacKintosh's speech _ It was the moral anger of disinterested spec--tators against atrocious crimes, the gravest and most dignified moral principle which the God of Justice has implanted in the human heart,that of which the dread is the only restraint on the actions of powerful criminals, & of which the promulgation is the only punishmentthat can be inflicted on them. It is a restraint which ought not to be weakened _ it is a punishment no good man can desire to mitigate.H. 166 I hope I may venture to say, that no English assembly need have endured such a sacrifice of eternal justice to any miserable interestof an hour.H. 167. If there be a decorum due to exalted rank and authority,there is also a much more sacred decorum due to virtue + to human nature, which would be outraged & trampled under foot, by speaking of guilt in a lukewarm language language,falsely called moderate.H170 Those only can defend themselves with valeur, who areanimated by the moral approbation with which they can surveytheir sentiments towards others, who are ennobled in their own eyes by a consciousness that they are fighting for justice as well as well as interest, a consciousness which non can feel, but thosewho have felt for the wrongs of their brethren.H p 89 Libel undefinable. 12 July 1803 Picture of the Treasury
