SECT. I. Law in general.2A Definition should be composed of terms that [The terms employ'd in a Definition should] have a meaningin the mind of him who uses them; that meaning should be suchshould be more simple in it's conception than that of the termthey are made use of to define to be defined: it should be the same at one time as at ano--ther: it should be true of one as well as another of the things cha--racterized by the term to be defined: it should be such as may contribute to distinguish the things defined from other things theymay be in danger of being confounded with. IIn short if we may be allowed to say what it ought not to be: it oughtuninstructive not to be unmeaning, dark, ambiguous, fluctuating, narrow,or uncharacteristic. I am in great doubt how this descriptionof a good definition will tally with our Author's.The first thing we are told of Law is, that it is a rule of action This is what may be very true. But what we are the wiser for it,or how it, or how it can serve to distinguish Law from any thingit is in danger of being confounded with is rather more than Ican conceive. The signification of the world "rule" is so looseand vague that it is still more difficult to fix the import of itthan that of the term Law: and the entire expression a ruleof action, as soon as it appears to express any thing, appears toexpress what is rather an accidental attribute of any Law, thanas may be made visible to those whom they are addressed to: iteasy to apprehendSect.
