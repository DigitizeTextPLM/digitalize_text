expect to find it within the compass of human ability, though devoted exclusively to the service, to bring the improved English prisons in question upon a level in point of economy with that of Philadelphia. It is not without surprize that in some instances within my reach Dorsetshire in particular (Oxfordshire I have but an indistinct recollection of) I have observed in how meritorious a degree these obstacles have been overcome. In these home instances the grand misfortune is, that in regard to the main object _ the object with reference to which example and reformation themselves are but as means to an end _ I mean the decreased of crimes _ circumstances do not admit of their affording any such satisfactory proofs of efficacy as in the more favourable situation of the Philadelphia prison may be and have been afforded: _ why? _ because the good effects of the discipline of these good jails are to such a degree drowned in the bad effects of the surrounding bad ones. * In Pensylvanyia too & in New York, the whole system of penal justice is invigorated by the abolition of capital punishment as above: while in England the debility resulting from the opposite excess (by debility I mean the relaxation that pervades the whole system of procedure) is such as cannot be compensated in any ascertainable degree by the utmost efficacy of such local & partial improvements.Would (c)20Letter 3d
