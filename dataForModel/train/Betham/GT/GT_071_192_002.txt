14.COf Culpable InsolvencyInnocent or culpable, culpable in a less degree or in a greater degree, it makes no difference. It puts innocence upon a worse footing than criminality. It invites men to commit crimes. If a man steals he may be whipped or sent to live at large in another country for, Seven Years, or be confined to work for two or three Years. If he borrows, he may be confined for life. All the while care is taken not to ask the debtor a= :bout his effects: that would be an easy and natural way of coming at them, which the Common Law abhors. This is ow= :ing to excess of tenderness: it would be a hardship to him to oblige him to tell any thing which he does not like to tell: it would be like making him confess himself a criminal: to save this it punishes him worse than if he were. To make amends for the oppression thus exercised upon the Debtor, the Law extends it to the Creditor. It seems an= :gry with him for making use of the only miserable remedyit (a)Note[(a) Only] I am speaking all along, it is to be remembered, of the case where the property is not visible. Where it is there is no need either of Imprisonment or examination.
