For retaining the article relative to the insuring of the lives of the Prisoners.Principle will be found to concur with precedent in recommend Under the article the Governor gets a small annual pre--mium for every prisoner kept alive : paying for every one who dies a heavy fine ; and this without proof of deliquency or possibility of evasion. The nature of things does not afford another expedient of equal efficacy for effecting that intimacy of union between between interest and duty the want of which has been the sole and universally acknowledged of the miseries andabuses which have been so notoriously prevalent in prisons. It applies to this purpose the united powers of reward and punishment, without the expence of the one or the hardship of the other : at the same time that, so far as punishment is concerned , it produces its effect with that degree of certainty with which nothing that goes by that name and is administered as such can ever be attended with. Legal penalties can attack only upon specific acts : upon the wounding , starving or poisoning men outright. _ They afford very little security against destructive habits : against the being killed by inches or by neglect : worn out by want of rest or nou--rishment : poisoned by bad provisions or unwholesome trades and occupations.The -ing it.cause Reasons 29 June 1795.
