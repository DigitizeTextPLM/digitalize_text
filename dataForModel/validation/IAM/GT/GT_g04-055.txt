We also had a little Mission Hall leading off the Brighton Road, in a street full of smallhouses. This was called Ellen Avenue when I first went there, but was soon changedinto the better-sounding name of Lansdowne Road. There were lots of children there,and we had a flourishing Sunday School and an evening service. I soon saw that theparish needed more help both at the church and Mission district.
