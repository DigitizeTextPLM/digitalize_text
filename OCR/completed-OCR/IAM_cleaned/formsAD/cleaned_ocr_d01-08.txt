The bar was the commonest marking, but others were also used. Dots sometimes
served in place of the bar, and there are cases where spacing is used as it is now used
to mark a paragraph ending. Frequently paragraphos markings were omitted. C. H.
Roberts is of the opinion that in the original of the Fourth Gospel some markings
would be used, although which, it is impossible to say.
