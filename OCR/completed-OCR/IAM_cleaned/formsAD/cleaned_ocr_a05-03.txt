There was a computed 8.4 per cent. swing towards the Nationalist party of Dr.
Verwoerd, the Prime Minister. This implies the disappearance of the Progressive
party from the House. Early results in yesterday’s general election showed Nationalists
being returned in their strongholds, like Bloemfontein and the Transvaal, with slightly
increased majorities. In the Cape, the veteran United Party politician, Mr. Harry
Lawrence, standing as a Progressive, was defeated in his constituency, Salt River, by
the United party candidate, Mr. H. M. Timoney.
