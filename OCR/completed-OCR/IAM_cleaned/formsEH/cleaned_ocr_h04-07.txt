The relative expenditure per child declined from 1952 to 1956, but rose in 1957 when
the subsidy on welfare and national dried milk was reduced; since 1957 it has again
declined. Most of the average expenditure associated with a child was on cereal foods,
potatoes and milk; for fresh green vegetables, fruit, cheese, fish and carcase meat, the

incremental expenditure was slight.
