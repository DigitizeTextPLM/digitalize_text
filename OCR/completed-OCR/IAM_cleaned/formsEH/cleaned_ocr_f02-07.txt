1. Are there differences in adjustment to ageing and retirement according to the
occupational level of employees? 2. If so, which occupational levels are the better or
the poorer prepared for successful adjustment to retirement and in what aspects? 3.
Does the evidence obtained support a rationale for adapting a pre-retirement planning
and preparation programme to the needs of older employees of different occupational
levels?
