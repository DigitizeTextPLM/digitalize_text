A small manual coffee grinder is useful as the resin cannot be ground with a mortar
and pestle. The sieved resin is washed repeatedly with distilled water to remove fines
and then with hydrochloric acid to convert the resin completely to the chloride form.
The 60-100 mesh resin is again washed with water to remove the acid and finally dried
in air.
