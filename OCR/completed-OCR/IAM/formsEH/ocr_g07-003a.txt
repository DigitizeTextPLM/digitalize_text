His only reference to Trelawny by name in the course of several communications to
Hobhouse and Kinnaird about Byron’s affairs is satirical: ’"I have not the lLhonor of
any acquaintance with Mr Trelawny who seems to have had charge of the Mule when
Count Gamba accompanied the remains of our deceased friend to Zante....’ If Trelawny
failed even to meet Lord Sidney and the British Government’s other representatives
in the islands, while they warmly welcomed Gamba to their counsels, it would go far
to explain his attempts to exalt himself at the young Italian’s expense.
