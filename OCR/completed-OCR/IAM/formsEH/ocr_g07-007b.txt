Sentence Database G07-007

In his popular and acutely unreliable book on Byron and Shelley, Trelawny implies
that not only Gamba but Fletcher and Tita and the steward, Lega Zambelli, failed to
perform the most elementary duties towards the dead. He pretends to have found ev-
erything in uttermost disorder - ’tokens that the Pilgrim had most treasured, scattered
on the floor, - as rubbish of no marketable value, and trampled on’.
