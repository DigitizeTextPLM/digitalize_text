Monsieur V’s house was immediately surrounded by firemen and other officials, but
there was no Monsieur V. He telephoned a few minutes later from a nearby village,
apologising for the trouble, but explaining that the walls were porous and the gas had
escaped. General relief was expressed, but Monsieur V (this was actually reported in
the next issue) returned home and shot himself, leaving a note which again left his
household goods to the superintendent.
