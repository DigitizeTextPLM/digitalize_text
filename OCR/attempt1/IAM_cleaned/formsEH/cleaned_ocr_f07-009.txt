And, if certain dishes and modes of food have persisted down the ages, the motive
that preserved them has always been the same. Apart from the need for nourishment,
the instinct of hospitality has always been strong in mankind. The sharing of a meal
in those earliest dangerous days was an admittance into an acquaintanceship far more
important than the casual meetings of the present day; the desire to share something
more intimate than mere converse has always been there.
