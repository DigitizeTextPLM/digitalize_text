The equipment takes two forms - an insulating guard on the jib of the crane, intended
to prevent direct contact with the line, and electronic equipment with a sensitive
probe mounted slightly forward of the head of the jib and with electronic assembly

and warning apparatus in the driverâ€™s cab. Improved designs of both forms are being
tried out at present.
