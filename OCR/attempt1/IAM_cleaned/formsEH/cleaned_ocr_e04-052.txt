For instance, in Canada we use galvanised nails in place of screws. We just bend them
over and clamp firmly by using a hammer on each side. Over here I’ve always used
brass screws, which are more expensive. The first job is to make your moulds. In Fig.

nailed and glued together strongly, it may be marked and cut to shape later.
