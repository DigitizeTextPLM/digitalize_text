HERE is a project that will be welcomed by the family man or father-to-be. Unlike
many commercial articles, this chair is solidly built and capable of withstanding the
heavy handling of the most destructive youngster. Almost any available timber can
be used but Parana pine is recommended, being cheap, easy to work, and taking a
good finish.
