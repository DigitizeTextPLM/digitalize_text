Their friendship for Augusta became rather hollow, and the news that Byron had left
her practically all his money caused it to crumble to oblivion. Though Lady Byron
knew perfectly well that Byron, as early as the year of their wedding, 1815, had made
a will in Augusta’s favour, she had evidently not passed on that information; and it
came as an appalling surprise to Captain Byron that he had been left without the
fortune that would keep up the title.
