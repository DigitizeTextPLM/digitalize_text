2. We have held eleven meetings. We decided as a first step to seek information from

a number of organisations and persons having an interest in the questions before us
and at a later stage we arranged for publication of a press notice inviting anybody
interested to submit representations. We compiled a list of the points which we
thought were of importance, but we made it clear that the replies need not be confined
to these particular items.
