Except at Hemel Hempstead, large office organisations have until quite recently shown

little interest in the new towns, probably because of the difficulty in the early years
in recruiting suitable staff, especially junior staff, locally. There is evidence of greater
interest today, with nearly half a million square feet of office space under construction
- almost as much as the total area so far completed.
