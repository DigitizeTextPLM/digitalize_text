At one and the same time, therefore, occur the beat of the apex, the thickening of the
heart walls, and the forcible expulsion of their contained blood by the contraction of
the ventricles. Going on in Chapter Three to the movement of the arteries, likewise
gauged from the dissections of living animals, Harvey noted that contraction of the
heart and the apex beat occur in systole, simultaneously with dilatation of the arteries
and of the artery-like vein, and expulsion of the ventricular content.
