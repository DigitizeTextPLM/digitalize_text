I suggested to the congregation that it needed warming up by constant prayer and
worship, and we found many to help. Gifts of candlesticks and stained-glass lancet
windows - finally a new altar - helped to furnish the chapel as a little sanctuary for
prayer and quiet. In time we received similar gifts for the High Altar, and large East
and West windows.
