Wholesale chemical spraying, upsetting as it does the balance of nature by killing
both pests and predators, is viewed with concern by a number of American State
Research Stations. Not content with issuing bulletins on the dangers of the misuse of
chemicals in agriculture, some stations are carrying out useful research on pest control
by biological means. Both native and imported predatory insects and insect pathogens
are used in field trial tests.
