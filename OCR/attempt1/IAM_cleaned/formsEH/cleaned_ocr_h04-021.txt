As in 1958, younger couples paid some 12 1/2 per cent more per calorie than the
national average, and families with four or more children 19 per cent less. The only
substantial change was in families with three children, for whom the index declined
from 91 to 88. Table 27 also shows the corresponding values of an index which com-
pares the prices paid by different types of household for the commodities constituting
the average household diet in 1959.
