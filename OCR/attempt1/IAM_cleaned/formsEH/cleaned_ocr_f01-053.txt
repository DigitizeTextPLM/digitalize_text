The job of the teacher is to set the learner’s vocabulary to work on the existing store
so as to make it grow. He does not simply pack new things into the store. The solitary
learner has to find out how to do this for himself, with the help of books. He uses his
vocabulary to ask questions and uses the books to find the answers.
