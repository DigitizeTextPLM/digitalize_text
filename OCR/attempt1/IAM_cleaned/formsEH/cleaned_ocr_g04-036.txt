IN 1913 Dr. Burge, Bishop of Southwark, asked me to go as Vicar of St. Mark’s,
Woodcote, Purley, a new church built by the well-known architect Mr. George Fel-
lowes Prynne, who was to become a very intimate friend, and I was later on joint
executor of his estate with his solicitor cousin. As Bishop Talbot had told me that I
ought not to spend many years in Tatsfield, we held great family consultations.
