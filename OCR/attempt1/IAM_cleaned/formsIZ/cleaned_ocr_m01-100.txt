Absorption of the beta particles is also kept to a minimum but the accuracy and
precision of weighing the precipitated sources suffers. All precipitates were weighed
on a semi-micro balance which had been calibrated with a set of certificated weights
from the National Physical Laboratory. Complete chemical exchange between the
radio-lead and the added lead carrier is necessary if the analytical results are to be

correct.
