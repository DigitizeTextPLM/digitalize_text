This resulted in units of much lighter weight than could be obtained with tubular
constructions. The growth of the aircraft industry brought even greater emphasis to
the need for lightweight compact heat exchangers. During the 1930â€™s, the secondary
surface plate-and-corrugation construction became established for aero-engine radia-

tors, using dip-soldered copper. The air and engine-coolant passages were separated
by flat plates.
