In a corner of the saloon bar of the Six Bells at Hawkeshurst that Friday night Hugh
Mansell and Roddy Dowell drank their beer and waited. It’s too damn busy in here.
We can’t expect him to leave his customers’, Hugh said morosely. ’Give him a chance,
old chap. He’ll be over. Jim’s a most reliable chap when it comes to picking up a
small tip.’
