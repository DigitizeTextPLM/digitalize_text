The migrating stages all come from 100-250 meters, and the time of their arrival at
the surface is directly related to their swimming capacity: 3rd (oldest) calyptopis from
1800-2200 hr; 2nd, from 2200-0200 hr; and 1st, from 0200-0600 hr. Similar ontogenetic
differences are apparent in Bosmina coregoni whose adults remain at the surface while
the young migrate to and from a depth of 50 meters.
