exactly the Ritz Hotel but we’ve got our little comforts,” said Dowd. He introduced the
men who’d come in as Roper Smith, Shorty, Mick Golightly, Swede and the Sodbuster.
This last was the little hombre in big overalls. Very soon he had tin mugs filled with
hot black coffee sweetened with molasses for all and for us there were two plates of
beans.
