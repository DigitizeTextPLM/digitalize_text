Mr. Healey denounced the Government for using double standards. Ministers had
rebuked the unaligned nations for not condemning the new Russian tests, but they
themselves had no condemnation for events in Angola or Algeria. It was not for the
Government, said Mr. Healey, to take up moral attitudes, ” especially when the temple
of their religion is the bingo-parlour.”
