The defeat of the leader of the Progressive party, Dr. Steytler, in Port Elizabeth South,
announced immediately afterwards by the United party candidate, Mr. Plewman, left
the Progressives deprived of both their chief figures. Dr. Verwoerd and the Leader of
the Opposition, Sir de Villiers Graaff, have been returned unopposed. The contests
were for 86 seats as 70 Nationalists and 20 United party candidates are unopposed.
