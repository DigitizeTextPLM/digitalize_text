AN experiment in courtesy is launched by the Electricity Board. The board is laying
a cable along a seven-mile route in Surrey. A warden, Mr. Jack Finlay, has been
appointed to smooth out difficulties for householders when trenches are dug outside
their front gates. Splendid. By showing concern for the people the board will earn
their good will. Happy patrolling, Mr. Finlay!
