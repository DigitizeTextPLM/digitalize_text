It has a great look of speed and technical fun about it, of enormous cinematic enjoy-
ment, and above all of cinematic sense. Much of it has that air of improvisation, as of
off-the-cuff living, that once seemed so new and so attractive. The story (not that the
story, in the sense of plot, matters much; but in the sense of situation and movement
it matters a lot) is that of a man on the run (Jean-Paul Belmondo), who spends a few
days with an American girl (Jean Seberg) who is bearing his child (though paternity
is always a rather dubious business among the new wave): an affair that remains
spiritually unconsummated as they move on to the final betrayal.
