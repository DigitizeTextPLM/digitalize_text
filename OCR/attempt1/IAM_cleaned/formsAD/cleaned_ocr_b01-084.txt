That was the first point that Mr. Hammarskjold made. India has responded hand-
somely by providing 3,000 men, who must take about a fortnight to arrive. If the UN
forces were thick enough on the ground, such incidents as that at Matadi would not
happen. THE UN’s ability to keep peace depends simply on adequate support by the
nations which have set their hands to this plough.
