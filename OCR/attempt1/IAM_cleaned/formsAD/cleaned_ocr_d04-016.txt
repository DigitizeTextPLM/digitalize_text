This man is the worm, the creature that cuts and polishes Altar-Stones. Such a man

is the Shamir that guards himself against all the irrelevant pleasures. Such a Shamir
possesses the real acid to mould our character, to melt our heart of stone. This Shamir
helps us earthly creatures to build an Altar for God to come nearer to God.
