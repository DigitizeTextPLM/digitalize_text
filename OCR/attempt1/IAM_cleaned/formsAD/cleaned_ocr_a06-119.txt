Note circulation soared for the sixth successive week - this time by more than 15,000,000
last week. And that brought the figure to a record 2,415,000,000. This was 100,000,000
more than the corresponding week last year and 37,000,000 up on the 1960 record set
last Christmas. Now look at the other side of all these coins.
