At first sight the difference between Souter and the other texts is rather large. But
the British text includes the paragraph 7.53-8.11, the Woman taken in Adultery, and
this accounts for 178 words out of 279, which is the difference between the 15,695
words of Souter’s text and the 15,416 of Nestle’s. The omission or inclusion of this
paragraph is a matter of editorial decision rather than scribal emendation, and it must
be included in the Gospel and studied, even if the result of the study were to decide
that the paragraph should then be excluded.
