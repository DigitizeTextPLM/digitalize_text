King Freddie and three other hereditary rulers of native kingdoms in Uganda arrived
for talks with Colonial Secretary Mr. Iain Macleod, before the Uganda Constitutional
conference opens next Monday. The question: Their status in an independent Uganda.
The thorniest problem for next week’s conference is to settle the relationships between

and recommended a form of federal association, but the four kings are not committing
themselves and not attending the actual conference, although Buganda politicians have
agreed to do so at the last minute.
