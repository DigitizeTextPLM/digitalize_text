The lower platen, which supports the leather, is raised hydraulically to bring it into
contact with the rollers on the upper platen, which is then caused to make several
horizontal oscillations so that the leather is rolled and pressed at the same time. The
danger zone between the platens is fenced by a guard which is interlocked with the
hydraulic valve and the press is also sequentially operated: the closing of the shutter
starts the machine, the rest of the cycle following automatically.
