One big advantage of soil blocks is an obvious one: the cost of a pot of any description
is saved completely. Manufacturing the block and planting it is very little more trouble
than normal potting, and a superior plant, which transplants more easily, is produced.
The obvious limitation is that soil blocks can only be used for propagating; there can
be no progression to a larger block when the plant or seedling is ready to be moved;
it must be planted out or potted.
