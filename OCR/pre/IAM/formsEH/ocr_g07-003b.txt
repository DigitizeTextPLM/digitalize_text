Hobhouse and Kinnaird about Byron’s affairs is satirical: ’I have not the lhonor of
any acquaintance with Mr Trelawny who seems to have had charge of the Mule when
Count Gamba accompanied the remains of our deceased friend to Zante....’ If Trelawny

in the islands, while they warmly welcomed Gamba to their counsels, it would go far
to explain his attempts to exalt himself at the young Italian’s expense.
