This development coincided with the introduction of pressurized aircraft cabins and
the demand for air-to-air cabin coolers. Although in this case the heat transfer co-
efficients on the two sides of the heat exchanger were of comparable magnitude, the
use of secondary surface was still attractive, since the greater part of the surface area
could be made up of fins only 0.006 in. (0.15 mm.) thick.
