If there is sufficient beta activity, the radiochemical purity of the Bi-210 may be
checked by observing the decay curve. The removal of lead chromate from the alu-
minium counting tray together with the bismuth-210 prior to the second ion exchange
separation has been checked by counting the trays. Not more than 0.2of the bismuth-
210 remains on the tray after the acid wash.
