There is a curd of morning smoke and a muffled bell taps the sky. Here we stopped, as
in fine weather we always stopped. Down below is the village of Cagnes, but between
are pockets of heat and cold like the hands of friends or strangers, and a flurry of early
smells, the dark bosoms of beech and the thin pine fingers kissed by the sun.
