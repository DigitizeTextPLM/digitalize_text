Motion there was, but motion without event - except for those negligible events that
seemed so large to the creatures participating in them. For Lily-yo, Flor and Haris
there were many events. Chief of these was that they learned to fly properly. The
pains associated with their wings soon died away as the wonderful new flesh and tendon
strengthened. To sail up in the light gravity became an increasing delight - the ugly
flopping movements of flymen on the Heavy World had no place here.
