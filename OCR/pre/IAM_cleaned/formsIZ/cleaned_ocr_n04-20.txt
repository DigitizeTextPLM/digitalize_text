Glad I met you. Don’t forget to give me a ring - any time - knock twice and ask for
Bawley, what?” ”I don’t know when that will be,” said John. ”I shall be busy for
a while, cleaning up after Master bloody Munyard.” THERE were six submarines,
lying in pairs alongside the jetty at Fort Blockhouse. Black and grimly businesslike
they both looked and sounded, for all of them were rumbling as they charged their
electric batteries.
