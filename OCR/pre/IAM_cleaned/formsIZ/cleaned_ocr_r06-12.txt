At the school, which is charming, civilised and expensive, the two children walked
together across green fields, and I followed, seeing how the sun gilded their bright
friendly heads turned towards each other as they talked. In Catherine’s left hand she
carried the stories of Isaac Babel. After lunch we went to the pictures. Philip allowed
it to be seen that he thought going to the pictures just for the fun of it was not worthy
of intelligent people, but he made the concession, for our sakes.
