would, as an executive, be eternally differentiated from the Governors. Fairbanks
managed the Governors beautifully, he knew more than they, he was cleverer than
most, discreetly used their Christian names - but remained their servant. They had no
office hours, however elastic; their lives were spent in committee making decisions for
others to execute on the basis of data laboriously gathered for them; they moved from
board-room to board-room, encountering a succession of new pencils, clean towels,
institutional crystal and silver, protein-rich lunches, immaculate agendas, able slaves.
