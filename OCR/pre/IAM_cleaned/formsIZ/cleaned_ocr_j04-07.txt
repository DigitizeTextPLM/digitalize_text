Polonium-210 remains on the column and does not interfere. Strontium does not
form a chloro-complex and therefore passes through in the feed solution and the first
wash. The resin is used for a single separation and then thrown away. In the first
stage of the analysis, only the fraction containing lead-210 is collected. The lead is
precipitated as the chromate, washed, slurried onto an aluminium counting tray, dried
under an infra-red lamp, weighed, and set aside for five days while the bismuth-210
grows in.
