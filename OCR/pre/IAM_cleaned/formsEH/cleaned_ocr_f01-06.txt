And then you get a knock on the head and all evidence of ”mind” vanishes, at any rate
for some time. It seems very difficult to detach the mind from the brain, and all the
biological, surgical and pharmacological evidence points to a very close connection.
There is a lot to be said for keeping the word ”soul” to stand for what many believe
to be the imperishable essence of a man which is supposed to persist apart from
the body, and to reserve the more prosaic word ”mind” for the basis of all those
experiences and phenomena which are clearly associated with the brain.
