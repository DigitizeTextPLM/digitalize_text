This control over lettings also secures a balanced distribution of the type of shop, to
meet the convenience of shoppers, and a reasonable degree of economic security for
the individual shopkeeper. Timing has proved an important factor in the success of
the shops. Too many at the start may not provide a living for the traders, but too few
may result in failure to attract custom and the habit of dependence on mobile shops,
essential in the early stages, may be slow to break if carried on too long.
