Mauro’s first action was to write to his revered master at Ko” then, near Leipzig, asking

for advice. In doing so he described his distinguished patient and his symptoms.
He told Hahnemann that he found Anglesey a strong, energetic man with a gentle
and charming character, even-tempered and sedate, not easily irritated, patient and
persevering, ’but he appears to despair of ever being cured.’
