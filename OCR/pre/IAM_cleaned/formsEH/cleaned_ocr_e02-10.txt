Most tools have to lead an intensive life, and faults in design or quality soon become
apparent. It is far better to pay the fair price for a tool of good quality, and not
handicap yourself from the start. To put it in a slightly different way, do not allow
yourself to blame the tools when the job does not turn out quite right!
