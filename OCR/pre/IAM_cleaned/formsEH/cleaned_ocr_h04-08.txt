For this fairly small group, comparisons between different years cannot be made so
precisely as in groups with a defined number of children. In 1959 the households
in this group contained slightly more children (average 4.64) than in the previous
year (average 4.53). Their total food expenditure increased less than that in other
groups, and they purchased more of certain foods such as fish, poultry, eggs, canned
vegetables, fresh fruit, chocolate biscuits and breakfast cereals which, in general, are
more expensive sources of nutrients than those foods of which they purchased less,
namely dried milk, potatoes, carcase meat, sugar, bread, flour and oatmeal and oat
products.
