First of all simple part-songs: I found only one member who had any idea of reading
music. This was the village doctor who was an old school friend at Clifton. He could
sustain the tenor part quite well and lead the others. As for basses and altos the
conductor had to teach by singing the parts with them. It was very amusing, and by
the end of a few months an enthusiastic choir of men and women could render simple
part-singing tolerably well.
