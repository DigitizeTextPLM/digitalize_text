Dante Gabriel Rossetti had simple tastes in food. At one dinner he is said to have
been blind to the charms of turbot and to have been much more interested in the dish
in which it was served. He turned it over on the table cloth to examine the marks on
the back without going through the formality of having his turbot removed first.
