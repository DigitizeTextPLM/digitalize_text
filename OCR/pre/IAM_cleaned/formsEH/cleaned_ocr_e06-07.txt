Actually the seine net has little or no cover. And in this film the rise of the fish was
small, a matter of a foot or two. With round fish like haddock, which would hardly
find safety on the bottom, this cover would seem to be even more essential; but more
films are needed to prove this. Cover in the fast-moving trawl is considered essential
to catch round fish whose reaction to disturbance would be upwards.
