The East Anglian behaviour (see p. 82) has always differed from that of the summer
fisheries. There is the ”*swim” at slack waters, even in daylight sometimes; and the

other fascinating behaviour mysteries are peculiar to this fishery, which unfortunately
seems to be dying out; but a full discussion of them is beyond the present scope.
