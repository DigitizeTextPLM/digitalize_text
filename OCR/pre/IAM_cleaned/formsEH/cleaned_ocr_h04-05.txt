All groups except families with four or more children or with adolescents but no
children consumed more fresh green vegetables, especially in the first half of the
year, although most reduced their consumption of other vegetables. Purchases of
quick-frozen peas and beans generally increased, but extremely wide group differences
persisted, the averages ranging from 0.1 oz. per head per week in families with
four or more children to 0.9 oz. per head in younger two-adult households; average
consumption by older couples and other wholly-adult households was 0.5 oz. per head
per week.
