DESPITE the steady influx of substitutes since the end of the war, clay pots are still
in greatest demand. It is mostly in the smaller sizes that the substitutes have made
headway, and although numerous small clay pots are used each year, they are fewer
than they were 10 years ago. In the larger sizes there is still no real substitute for clay
that can be obtained at a comparable price, except the bituminized paper pots which
are used on commercial nurseries for growing tomatoes and chrysanthemums.
