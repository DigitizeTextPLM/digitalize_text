If you do not have a wooden floor on which to anchor the moulds, make a frame of
rough lumber as shown in Fig. 2. The main idea is to have the moulds standing as
rigid as possible, for it is on these you will be building and shaping your little craft,
upside-down. For cheapness I recommend using Douglas Fir Plywood from British
Columbia.
