The Austrian cuisine embraces the delectable 6Wiener Schnitzel as well as dishes
and stews heightened with aromatics where the paprika insinuates its perfidious fire,
aerian creams, ingenious pastries and a crescent-shaped breakfast roll created by a
pastry cook to celebrate the victory against the Turks in 1683. Spanish cookery is
reminiscent of bull-fights, of Spanish dancing and of Goja: it is vivid, highly coloured,
sometimes Quixotic and withal it has a sombre ardour, with streaks of poetry, meat
disguised under heavy and vehement sauces, pimentos and rancid butter.
