But what a change from the dear little old church at Tatsfield to the great modern

church of St. Mark’s at Purley. One felt at Tatsfield that, small as the church was,
it had its own atmosphere, and for centuries had been a House of Prayer. I could
not but feel the chilliness of the new church, beautiful as it was and is. When we
had found a group of people who gladly co-operated, we made the little side chapel a

place of daily prayer.
