I have also included a sketch of paddles I make for rowing this dinghy (Fig. 3). They
are very simple, cheap and easy to make. As will be seen from the plan there is only
a single gunwale on the outside. I find that the type of rowlock we use in Canada is
difficult to obtain here and expensive. I overcome this in another way as shown in
Fig. 4.
