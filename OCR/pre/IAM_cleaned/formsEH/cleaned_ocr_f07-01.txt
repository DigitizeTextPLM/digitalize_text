The truth is that good food offers a programme of entertainment almost unlimited in
its variety and its presentation affords an opportunity of showing a guest something of
ourselves. It is a far enough cry from the primitive meal-times of a simpler world to the
banquets of later days, when the table groaned under its load of complicated dishes,
and for all the blossoming of the arts around them the diners were little removed: it
was still fingers before forks - from their prototype, the hungry hunter.
