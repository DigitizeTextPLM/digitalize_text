In Chapter Two he gauged the nature of the heartâ€™s movements from the dissection of

living animals, showing how these movements alternate with rests and are seen best
in cold animals or in flagging warmer ones. At the time of its movement the heart
becomes generally constricted, its walls thicken, its ventricles decrease in volume and
it expels its content of blood, appearing paler in so doing in animals such as serpents,
frogs, and the like.
