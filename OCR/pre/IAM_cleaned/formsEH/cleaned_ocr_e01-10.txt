Remember that texture plays an important part in the beauty of crochet. The finer
mercerised threads are more effective for the delicate designs used for tablecloths,
doilies, edgings and accessories, while the heavier threads are used for bedspreads,
chairbacks, luncheon mats, etc. Crochet hooks are made of steel, composition or
bone. Steel crochet hooks range in size from number 3/0, the largest, to number 8,
the smallest.
