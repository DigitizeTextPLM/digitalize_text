Thus, musician David Lisbon’s chances of being a starred disc solo pianist were greatly
enhanced when he dug out A PACKET OF DRAWING-PINS. ” Why not,” thought
ex-soldier Mr. Lisbon, who is twenty-three, and lives in Dagenham, Essex, ” press a
thumb-tack into the nose of the hammers that strike the piano strings?” He did, on

his piano at home. There weren’t enough tacks and he got only the middle hammers
done.
