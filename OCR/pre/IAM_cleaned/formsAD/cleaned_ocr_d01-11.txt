Against these advantages the codex was fragile and might be bulky. It is sometimes
possible to tell whether or not a particular text was written on a roll or a codex. Rolls
were prepared for writing, but any papyrus left unused at the end could be cut off.
If the text was longer than the roll, a sheet could easily be glued on.
