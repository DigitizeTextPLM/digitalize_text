Informal talks at Lancaster House will resume today. PRESIDENT KENNEDY today
defended the appointment of a Negro as his Housing Minister. It has aroused strong
opposition from the anti-Negro senators of the Deep South. The negro is Mr. Robert
Weaver of New York. One of his tasks will be to see there is no racial discrimination
in Government and State housing projects.
