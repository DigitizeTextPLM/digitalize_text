In Fanny the pregnant girl is befriended by an old man. Here it is a young homosexual,
estranged from women but yet moved by a strong maternal instinct to the unborn
child as much as to the expectant mother, who acts as a protector and comforter
to her in her hour of need. He shares her room and gives her his forlorn gift of
companionship and sympathy - ”you need someone to love you while you are looking
for someone to love”.
