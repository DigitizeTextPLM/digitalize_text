On this reading what Mr Gollancz calls manoeuvring, and what we should call cool-
headed and inventive negotiation, is a means not to destruction but to safety. The

revision. This is news, however much the Government tries to disguise it by saying
that the revision would be ”in accordance with normal practice.”
