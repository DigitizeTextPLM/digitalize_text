Thus for the specific case of niobium in a sodium circuit a corrosion indicator could

be a reference electrode of sodium saturated and equilibrated with niobium sepa-
rated from the coolant by a solid anionic electrolyte. A negative voltage from the
reference electrode would mean oxidizing conditions for niobium and positive volt-
age, non-oxidizing conditions. The practical application of the above idea will involve
considerable experimentation before it can be realised.
