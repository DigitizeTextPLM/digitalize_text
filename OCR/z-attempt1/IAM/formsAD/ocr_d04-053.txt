Freedom from want cannot be fulfilled nor freedom from fear, fear of starvation in
the midst of plenty. Help will not be easily forthcoming for the people in need. They
will think of the animals first (which is of course our duty). Of course the individual
will eat and be full but: ”Take heed to yourself, that your heart be not deceived, and

enemy, the self-seeking self.
