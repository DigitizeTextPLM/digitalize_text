Mr. Thorneycroft, the Minister of Aviation, who arrives in Bonn tomorrow for talks
with the Federal Government on a European space satellite project, will find the
Germans interested in the principle of space research, but rather sceptical about

this is not primarily an effort on Britain’s part to salve Blue Streak, which was
abandoned last summer as a military project; or that the new European space satellite
is indeed to be purely scientific in character.
