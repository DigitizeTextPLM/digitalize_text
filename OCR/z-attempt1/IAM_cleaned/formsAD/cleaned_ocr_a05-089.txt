The early speakers in the debate each severely rated the speech of his predecessor.
These strictures were all too well justified. We started with the plaintive wailings
of Mr. Healey, ”Shadow” Foreign Secretary, described by Mr. Godber, Minister of

Defence Minister, for having read the House an ill-prepared essay.
