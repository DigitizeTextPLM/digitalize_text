Now we have the strikes and demonstrations in Ghana coinciding with the meet-
ing of the Commonwealth Economic Consultative Council - the first to be held in
Africa. Only a few hours after Mr Lloyd and his 24-strong delegation landed at Ac-

cra this morning, hundreds of shop assistants demonstrated outside the British-owned
Kingsway Stores, the largest in town.
