The Talmud describes that the Shamir lives in a sanctuary, and only some rare birds
know the existence of it. These birds are, the Cherubim and the Seraphim. We are
also told that the Shamir is the stylus used by Moses, and this stylus is described as
a very precious diamond-stone and very adamant.
