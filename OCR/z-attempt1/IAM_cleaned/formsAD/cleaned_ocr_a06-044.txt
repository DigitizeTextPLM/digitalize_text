Mr. Anthony Fell (Yarmouth) called the decision ”shocking” and added: ”It is the
most disastrous thing any Prime Minister has done for many, many generations.” He
concluded: ”The best service the Prime Minister can do would be to resign.” The
outburst shocked MPs of all parties. Even close friends were signalling Mr. Fell to
stop.
