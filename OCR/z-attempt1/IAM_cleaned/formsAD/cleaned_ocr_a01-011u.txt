Delegates from Mr. Kenneth Kaunda’s United National Independence Party (280,000
members) and Mr. Harry Nkumbula’s African National Congress (400,000) will meet
in London today to discuss a common course of action. Sir Roy is violently opposed to
Africans getting an elected majority in Northern Rhodesia, but the Colonial Secretary,

Mr. Iain Macleod, is insisting on a policy of change.
