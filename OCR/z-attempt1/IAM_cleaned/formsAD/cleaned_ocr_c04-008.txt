In his first Hollywood picture, ” Let’s Make Love,” he was swamped by the know-how

of Marilyn Monroe and Yves Montand. Against this couple Frankie, in a cardboard
role, didn’t stand a chance. Now comes ”The Right Approach” (Rialto, ”A”), and
it’s a glum business. He plays an aspiring actor - a selfish, arrogant, brash, ambi-
tious, unscrupulous heel - who would tread on anybody’s neck to get a break in the
Hollywood ratrace.
