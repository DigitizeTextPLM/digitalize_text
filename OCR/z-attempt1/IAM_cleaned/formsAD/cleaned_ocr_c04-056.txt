I canâ€™t recall a production where so many comics bolted in and out of holes so often.
The jokes were a reshuffle of the same old lot - this time Brian Rix lost his skirt instead
of his trousers. The action moved at tremendous speed, backed by some wonderful
timing by the cast. I especially liked the tea-cup scene where six of the cast changed
cups with the dexterity of Chinese jugglers.
