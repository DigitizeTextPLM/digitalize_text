cause the alternatives had been put clearly to the movement, which had then chosen a
vigorous anti-Nato, anti-Tory, anti-bomb and anti-German rearmament policy. Hopes

with the Tories. Many members understood that the bread-and-butter struggles of
the union would become easier in the context of a movement advancing to attack the
Tories on the whole front of their policy.
