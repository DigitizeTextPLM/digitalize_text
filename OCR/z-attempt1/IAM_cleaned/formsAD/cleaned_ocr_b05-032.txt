The travellers from the New World who had been in Britain many times before,
were slightly stunned. Afterwards they said: ”’We thought we knew it all, but you
Britishers never run out of unturned stones.”

To the British Travel Association, doing their excellent darndest, I offer these sad
complexities. IN the 1830’s the Luddites took sledge-hammers to their looms and
many a good trade unionist since then has, in the hope of improving the lot of his
fellow workers, taken the theoretical Luddite hammer again.
