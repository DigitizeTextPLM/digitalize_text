The possibility that the Government might invoke the Public Order Act, 1936, and
declare the whole rally illegal - whether the demonstrators sit down or not - was being

Pancras rent riots. Today Mr. Butler will have talks with Police Commissioner Sir
Joseph Simpson to draw up final plans for the ”Battle of Parliament Square.”
