The day I promised to take Catherine down to visit my young friend Philip at his
school in the country, we were to leave at eleven, but she arrived at nine. Her blue
dress was new, and so were her fashionable shoes. Her hair had just been done. She
looked more than ever like a pink and gold Renoir girl who expects everything from
life.
