We parked the Lambretta opposite the Negresco, and went to the beach to have a
swim. Amazing bedlam rocked in our eyes. The sea boiled with waves, they galloped
to the walls and spumed over the Promenade des Anglais. A huge crowd had collected.
There were firemen and policemen and ambulances, and the eyes of the spectators were
hard with disaster.
