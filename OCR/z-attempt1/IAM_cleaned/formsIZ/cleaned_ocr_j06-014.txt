Such reversed migrations are known for Acartia clausi, A. longiremis, Nyctiphanes
couchii, Evadne sp., Oithona nana, Daphnia lumholzi, Stages 4, 5, and adult of Calanus
finmarchicus, Diaptomus banforanus, and Cyclops bicuspidatus. An echo-producing
layer, which the authors think probably consists of euphausiids, has also been described
as, in part, regularly moving in a reverse manner. Most of these records are well
substantiated and involve whole populations rather than aberrant individuals.
