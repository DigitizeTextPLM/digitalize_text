From this side, Rivermead was less forbidding; it stood a long way back from the water

at the end of a velvety lawn flanked with flowering trees and shrubs. To the right of
the lawn, close to the water’s edge, stood an ancient boathouse shrouded in wistaria;
it was built across a narrow backwater and there was a delicate iron staircase climbing
the outer wall to a room above.
