Unless it is known at what oxygen potential a given material in the sodium coolant
circuit will start to oxidise the cell can only be used as has been suggested above, as
an oxygen concentration monitor. However, if a material oxidizes in sodium at a given
oxygen potential the reference electrode could be held at that potential and oxidizing
or reducing conditions in the coolant circuit for that material would be indicated by
a negative or positive potential at the reference electrode.
