But lace-making is by no means a lost art. It suffered a decline and fell into lamentably
low standards in the fussy over-furnishing of the Victorian age but it would take more
than a temporary lapse in good taste to destroy this lovely, viable craft. It has, in fact,
readily adapted itself to modern tastes and the illustrations in the following pages will
show how completely it is in sympathy with contemporary surroundings.
