All types of trader have been encouraged, from the large departmental store to the
small shoe-mender, with banks specially sited on corners or in separate courts to avoid
breaking into the shopping frontage. As in the case of factories and industrial sites,
the corporations’ policy has been to charge full commercial rents for their shops and
shopping sites. The cost of town centre development has been very high in some cases
with large paved areas and pleasant amenities and decorative features.
