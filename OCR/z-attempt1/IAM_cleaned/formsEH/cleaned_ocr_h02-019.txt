5. We recommended that, in general, any drug or pharmaceutical preparation which
has an action on the central nervous system and is liable to produce physical or
psychological deterioration should be confined to supply on prescription and that
an independent expert body should be responsible for advising which substances
should be so controlled. 6. As an interim and urgent measure, the Secretary of
State for the Home Department, on the recommendation of the Poisons Board, has
made Rules under which certain substances having an action on the central nervous
system are included in a new list of substances which may be sold by retail only on
the prescription of a duly qualified medical practitioner, registered dentist, registered
veterinary surgeon or registered veterinary practitioner.
