But in 1897, alas! there was no fingerprint bureau, no experts to check and photograph
any ’dabs’ it might have yielded. It was a tough case to tackle, and Superintendent
Robinson, of the L.S.W.R. Police, and Chief Inspector Marshall, of Scotland Yard,
combined forces in the investigation. While accepting the likelihood that Miss Camp
had been attacked for the sake of robbery, they did not overlook the possibility that
this might have disguised another motive, and a thorough check of her former men
friends and acquaintances began.
