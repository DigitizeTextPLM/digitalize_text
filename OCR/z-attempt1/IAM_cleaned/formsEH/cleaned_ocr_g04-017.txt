It was while I was at Tatsfield that I first visited Oberammergau in Bavaria to witness
the Passion Play. The place and its people were to play an important part in my life.
For five years in succession till war broke out in 1914, I spent my summer holidays
there and became very intimate with the people and the environs. Every year between
the Passion Plays, an interval of ten years, another play would be performed at the
small theatre in the village, when new talent would be discovered and trained.
