This remarkable man of medicine, whom Sir Francis Burdett described to Anglesey
a year or two later as ’more like a God upon earth than a human being’, had an
increasing number of disciples among unorthodox medical men in the cities of Europe.
One of these was the Neapolitan, Dr Giuseppe Mauro, whom Anglesey consulted in
May 1834.
