A great blow disturbed all our efforts in the following year, 1914, when war broke out.
Very soon Chaplains for the Forces were urgently needed, and I felt clearly that one
of us must volunteer. The Bishop, Dr. Burge, did not wish me to go then, as I had
barely been in the parish for a year. Mr. Evitt, however, was much less committed
than his Vicar, and he was accepted at once and was very soon in France where he did
splendid work until his health broke down and he had a bad attack of enteric fever.
