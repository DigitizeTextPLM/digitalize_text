3. On 23rd November, 1959, we submitted an Interim Report. This dealt with
two questions which arose from our terms of reference and which had been brought
specially to our notice. First, we were asked to examine the risks attending the abuse
of carbromal and bromvaletone and preparations containing these substances. The
Poisons Board had already considered this problem but, in the absence of sufficient
evidence that these compounds were widely abused, had not recommended them for
control as ’poisons” under the Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933.
