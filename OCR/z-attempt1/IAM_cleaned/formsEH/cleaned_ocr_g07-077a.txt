George Anson Byron had seen enough of the poet’s atrocious conduct as a husband to
be aware that Augusta, so far from being responsible for the collapse of the marriage,

deemed necessary all the same to enlighten him as to the suspicions in the background,
and he had repeated them to his newly married wife.
