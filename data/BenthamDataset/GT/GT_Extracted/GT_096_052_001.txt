That Clocks _ have Laws prescribed or dictated to them: is a proposition, which without senseso long as men content themselves with sounds, may pass for true:but so soon as any precise import is given to these words, must be seen plainly to be false.What is said of Law in general, we naturally expect to find agree _ with each sort of Law in particular: For what agrees with the Genus Noand untutored common sense bears testimony to the justice of it.For it is but a declaration of the sense that all mankind who care the words Genus and species, and know what they are saying, put up on those words.
