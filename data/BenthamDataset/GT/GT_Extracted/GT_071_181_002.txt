46Of Frauds relative to the Coin.Now that such a case will often happen has been shewn. It will often happen therefore that a man will be found who will unwillingly accept the counterfeit Coin, and if it stays upon his hands be a sufferer by it. This is the only point in the case that is material; whether, in default of an inducement which is always present somewhere or other and always ad==equate, there would be such or such another inducement, is a question altogether immaterial with a view to practice. If there be any one single man in the nation who will accept the counterfeit Coin, the mischief is as effectually incurred and that mischief is as great, as if there were ten thousand who would take it. It could ultimately fall upon no more than some one person in the former case, and that does equally in the latter. 2 The alarm is perhaps not always quite so great where foreign Coin is counterfeited or diminished as where a like inju= :ry is done to the domestic Country . All people who come toknow of it are not necessarily alarmed at it; but all people Coin. are who may have occasion to accept the counterfeit foreignCoin.C
