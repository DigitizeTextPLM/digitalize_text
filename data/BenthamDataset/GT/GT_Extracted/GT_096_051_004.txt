in the second case it means neither more nor less than a com--mand only expressed in an obscure and far fetched manner.The next thing the definition tells us of a Law, is that it is "prescri--bed". As to the word "prescribed," what it was intended to mean -here, it would be dangerous to say: especially if what I suspect be true, that with the appearance of meaning something, it wasintended to mean nothing.I can speak with a little more certainty as to what it means a page or two farther on.+ It there means either to speak,to write or in general to make signs, at any rate to communicate ideas.It (that is, Law) says he, "is likewise a rule prescribed. Be--cause a bare resolution confined in the breast of the Legisla--tor, with out manifesting itself by some external sign,can neverbe properly a Law. It is requisite that this resolution be no--tified to those who are to know it" [p. 45].To do our Author justice, it must be acknowledged, that though what is said of Law here, is said of Law general without res--triction, the paragraph in which it occurs stands next after a Paragraph in which municipal Law alone is mentioned.But "dictated" is the word he uses in the next page after that we are now considering; the subject of Law in general still upon the carpet "dictated," a word which plainly refers to speech or writing. This being the case, the work he has cut out for 44Sect.1. Of Law in General.Sect. I. Law in General.
