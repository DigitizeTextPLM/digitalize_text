9 P.68. December 1797. "Ben-nil-ling .... remains a silent specta-"-tor of the tumil tumultuous scene, until the moment when"the soldiers rushed in to save the life of Cole-be. His conduct "here became inexplicable. On a sudden, he chose to be in a rage "at something or other, and, threw a spear among the soldiers, "which dreadfully took effect on one of them, entering at his back"and coming out at the belly, close to the navel ....... "This man [Ben-nil-long] instead of making himself useful,"or shewing the least gratitude for the attentions which he received,"from every one, has become a most insolent and troublesome"savage. As it was impossible sometimes to avoid censuring "him for his conduilt conduct, he had been known to walk"about armed, and heard to declare it was for the express"purpose of spearing the governor whenever he saw him." _ 10 P.196. January 1799. [ A man was "sentenced to receive a "severe corporal punishment, for having shot a native (man)"at Botany Bay. Could the evidence of some of these people have "been taken, it was supposed that he would have been capitally"convicted, in which case he would certainly have suffered, the "governor being determined to put that article of his Majesty's "instructions in force, which, in placing these people under the"protection of the British Government, enjoined the punishing "any injury done to their persons or property, according to the"degree and nature of the offence. _ "When this man was brought out to be punished, several of "the natives were assembled for the purpose; and he received in their "presence as much <del>if</del> of his sentence as he could bear, they wit-"-nessing his sufferings with the most perfect indifference." _EconomyII Collins9
