For a new and less expensive modeof employing & reforming ConvictsThe author, having turned his thoughts to the Penitentiary system from its first origin, and having lately contrived a building in which any number of persons may be kept within the reach of being inspected during every moment of their lives, and having made out as he flatters himself to demonstration, that the only eligible mode of managing an establishment of such a nature, in a building of such a construction would be by contract, has been induced to make public the following proposal for maintaining & employ- -ing Convicts in general, or such of them as would otherwise be confined on board the Hulks, for 25 per Cent less than it costs Government to maintain them there at present; deducting also the average value of the work at present perform -ed by them for Government: upon the terms of his receiving the produce of their labour, taking upon himself the whole expence of building, with-out and advance to be made by Government for that purpose, requiring only that the abatement and deduction abovementioned shall be suspended for the first year.Upon Proposal17 March 1792
