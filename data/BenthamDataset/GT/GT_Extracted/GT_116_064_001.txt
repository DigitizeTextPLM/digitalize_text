which so alarmed and terrified them, that they instantly fled, leaving behind them their spears, &c. and about 20 bushels of Indian-corn which they had stolen."It was distressing to observe that every endeavour to "civilize these people proved fruitless. Although they lived among "the inhabitants of the different settlements, were kindly treated, "fed, and often cloathed, yet they were never found to profess the "smallest degree of gratitude for such favours. Even Even Ben-nil-long "was as destitute of this quality as the most ignorant of his coun--"trymen.
