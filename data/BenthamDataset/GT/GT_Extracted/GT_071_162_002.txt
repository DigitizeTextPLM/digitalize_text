Frauds relative to the Coin.portion of matter on which such stamp has been put by suchauthority, if, in a word, he either applies to any such piece a do=:cument + purporting to have been executed by a person by whom itwas not executed, or alters a document which has been executed bythe proper person, he commits in either case, a particular kindof Forgery. The profit arises from the difference in point ofvalue, between the counterfeit or diminished Coin, and thegenuine or entire, for which it is intended to be passed.This offence has commonly been stiled Treason, and,in many respects, treated as if it were so. But with as muchpropriety it might have been called by any other odiousname. It is not committed with the views, nor has it any of theeffects, of Treason. When a man coins false money it is notto usurp power, but property. It is not like Treason the Crimeof the Courtier or of the Soldier or of the Lawyer: but of the Ar=tizan. It is a crime not of ambition nor of conscience, but of ra=:pacity. If it were not for the gain a Man could have no Motiveto commit it. (a)These10C
