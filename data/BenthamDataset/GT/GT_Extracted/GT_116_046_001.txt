This is a most salutary consequence"of the amelioration of our penallaws _New York; 1802: Eddy,Letter 2d or 3 <gap/>; 1793: <gap/> p. 92. "Juries are not now unwilling to"convict; and pardons are not granted till they [the prisoners]"discover some appearances of amendment.Philadelphia; 1795. Liancourt, p. 29.

The executive also"has no sufficient motive to pardon a convict previous to the"execution of his sentence, since at any time he has the power"of doing it, after the criminal has demonstrated that he is"worthy of the indulgence. This certainty of punishment has"already proved a great check upon criminality".Philadelphia
