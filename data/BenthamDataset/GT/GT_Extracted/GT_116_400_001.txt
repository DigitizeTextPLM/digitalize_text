F.9 Duke of Portland to Lords of the Treasury. _ 14 Octr 1799.Pretends to have examined the Acts _ puts a groundless interpretation on them _ confusion and inconsistency _ Will not allow Panopticon any Convicts that can either be transported or kept in the Jails. it would check the imprisonmentof the 27th ultie desiring, by command of your Lordships, to beapprized of the number of Convicts, which the Panopticon pro--posed to be erected by Mr Bentham, is intended to accommo--date. I have examined  the Acts of the 19th and 34th of hispresent Majesty relative to the building of Penitentiary Houses for confining and employing in hard labour, person convictedof transportable and other Crimes. _ I understand the objects of those Acts to be, that suchPenitentiary Houses should be used principally as receptacles for such transportable Convicts, as the several gaols of the respective Counties cannot contain, from the time of their receiving sentence, till an opportunity may offer for their being trans--ported. (c) With respect to the probably number of transportable Convicts, no safer rule can be adopted, than by taking the greatest num--ber of the four last years of Peace: [though it may increase, yetthe increase yet th of live stock & will probably more than counterbalance the difference .....] ] (d) As to other Convicts, it will depend on the opinion of the Judges who try them, what number of them it may be proper to confine in the Panopticon: it is impossible to ascer--tain with accuracy the number to which they may amount: but I incline to think it would be very inexpedient to move such Persons from the country Gaols, unless the crowded state of those Gaols should render it absolutely necessary: for itwould naturally tend _ ; not only to check that  spirit of im--provement, which now so universally prevails, in the severalCountiesin the Jails _ Will not execute the Acts _ because the expence would fall on governmentyet proposes 2150 as the number.
