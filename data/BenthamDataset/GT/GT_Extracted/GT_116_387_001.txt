I have Majesty, relative to the building of Penitentiary Houses for confining and employing in hard labour, PersonsI understand the object of these Acts to be, thatsuch Penitentiary Houses should be used principallyas receptacles for such transportable Convicts as the several Gaols of the respective Counties cannot contain, from the time of their receiving sentence, till anopportunity may offer for their being transported. With respect to the probably number of transport--able Convicts _ no safer rule can be adopted, than by taking the greatest number of the four last years of Peace:though it may increase, yet the increase of live Stock use will probably more than counter balance the difference.] will probably more than counterbalance the difference.examined the Acts of the 19th & 34th of his presentconvicted of transportable and other Crimes.
