12I. Conduct of the Governor towards Expirees, principally in relationto their liberty of departure, before the month of August 1792: beingthe time at which the intelligence was received, of the Instructionssubjecting it to his will and pleasure.No. 1 (p. 74) July 1789. The situation in which Expirees ingeneral now found themselves placed has been already stated.By one individual in particular, an experimental proof of thenature of the situation was at this same time received. Theonly evidence by which the Governor's right to confine any bodyin New South Wales could be established not being forth--coming, a man in whose instance there was no doubt butthat his time of punishment was expired, claimed his liberty.For the course of his argument, having used some words whichthough not mentioned were deemed "disrespectful to the"Lieutenant Governor", he was punished with six hundred lashes,and kept in irons for six months. A very instructive examplecertainly: it showed more what was to be got by talking about rights.No. 2 (p. 130) August 1790. Another freeman trying to quit theColony punished "for taking a very improper mode". The act itselfconsisted in the exercise of that liberty which the law of the landhad saved to him, and which no man alive had any right somuch as to pretend to give him leave to exercise. The improprietyof the mode consisted in the not asking leave, at the risk ofreceiving six hundred lashes and wearing irons for six months.Mode of punishment of course flogging though not mentioned:number of lashes not mentioned. This freeman "was punished to--"gether with a Convict" (bondsman) who had made a like attemptin the same ship at the same time. As far as can be judged,right or no right made no sort of difference.No. 3.
