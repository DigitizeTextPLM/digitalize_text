Coming now to the actual tools and their cost, we begin with what we have called abare minimum kit. Probably most men have some of the tools already. It will enablea man to make simple, straight-forward things, and in any case may be regarded asa good beginning to which other tools can be added as the need arises. The natureof the work will probably dictate the additions to be made, but as a guide we havegiven a fuller kit which increases the range of things that can be made enormously.
