London was again in turmoil; but this time over a question of trade rivalry. A richmerchant from Genoa had been murdered, and John de Kyrkby, a Londoner, wasone of those charged with the crime.

The city merchants were jealousof foreign merchants who could tempt court and baronage with rarer luxuries thanthose within the scope of English traders, and whose prices could not be controlledin the interests of the city rings.
