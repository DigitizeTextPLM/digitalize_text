A great blow disturbed all our efforts in the following year, 1914, when war broke out.Very soon Chaplains for the Forces were urgently needed, and I felt clearly that oneof us must volunteer. The Bishop, Dr. Burge, did not wish me to go then, as I hadbarely been in the parish for a year. Mr. Evitt, however, was much less committedthan his Vicar, and he was accepted at once and was very soon in France where he didsplendid work until his health broke down and he had a bad attack of enteric fever.
