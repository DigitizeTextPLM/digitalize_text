King Freddie and three other hereditary rulers of native kingdoms in Uganda arrivedfor talks with Colonial Secretary Mr. Iain Macleod, before the Uganda Constitutionalconference opens next Monday. The question: Their status in an independent Uganda.The thorniest problem for next week's conference is to settle the relationships betweenthem and the rest of the country. A Government report has recognised their rightsand recommended a form of federal association, but the four kings are not committingthemselves and not attending the actual conference, although Buganda politicians haveagreed to do so at the last minute.
