A new method of applying sand to the faces of green bricks has recently been devel-oped. In the case of wire-cut bricks the column of clay from the pug-mill is carriedby a short length of belt conveyor to the sanding plant. This consists basically of avibrating hopper from which the sand is distributed to all four faces by a system ofslots, scrapers and worms.
