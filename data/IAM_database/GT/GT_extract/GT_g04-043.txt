But what a change from the dear little old church at Tatsfield to the great modernchurch of St. Mark's at Purley. One felt at Tatsfield that, small as the church was,it had its own atmosphere, and for centuries had been a House of Prayer. I couldnot but feel the chilliness of the new church, beautiful as it was and is. When wehad found a group of people who gladly co-operated, we made the little side chapel aplace of daily prayer.
