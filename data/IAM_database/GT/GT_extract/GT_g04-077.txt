Very soon we managed to get a hut in Purley where soldiers were very welcome andthe ladies organized a canteen. Life was in those years more than busy. We now hada vicarage next to the church, and I was most fortunate in having for eight years amost able and devoted housekeeper whom I had known well in Limpsfield where shehad a house next to the church.
