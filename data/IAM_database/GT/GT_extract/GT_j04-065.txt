The exact volume of the eluting agents must be found by experiment for each batchof resin using radioactive tracer (lead-210, bismuth-210). A typical elution curve isshown in Figure 3. Once these volumes have been established, the weight of resinused is also fixed. All available evidence indicates that the fractions containing leadand bismuth are free of cross contamination apart from the natural ingrowth of thedaughters arising from the decay of lead.
