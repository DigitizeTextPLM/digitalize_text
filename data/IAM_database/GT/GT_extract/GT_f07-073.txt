The Austrian cuisine embraces the delectable 6Wiener Schnitzel as well as dishesand stews heightened with aromatics where the paprika insinuates its perfidious fire,aerian creams, ingenious pastries and a crescent-shaped breakfast roll created by apastry cook to celebrate the victory against the Turks in 1683. Spanish cookery isreminiscent of bull-fights, of Spanish dancing and of Goja: it is vivid, highly coloured,sometimes Quixotic and withal it has a sombre ardour, with streaks of poetry, meatdisguised under heavy and vehement sauces, pimentos and rancid butter.
