Arterial pulsation disappears with cessation of ventricular contraction. During cuttingor puncture of the ventricles, there is often forcible expulsion of blood from the wound.Arterial diastole is thus synchronous with cardiac systole but, when movement ofblood through arteries is hindered by compression, infarction or interception, themore distal arteries pulsate less because their pulse is nothing other than the impulseof the blood entering them.
