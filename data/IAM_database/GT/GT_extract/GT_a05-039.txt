There was a computed 8.4 per cent. swing towards the Nationalist party of Dr.Verwoerd, the Prime Minister. This implies the disappearance of the Progressiveparty from the House. Early results in yesterday's general election showed Nationalistsbeing returned in their strongholds, like Bloemfontein and the Transvaal, with slightlyincreased majorities. In the Cape, the veteran United Party politician, Mr. HarryLawrence, standing as a Progressive, was defeated in his constituency, Salt River, bythe United party candidate, Mr. H. M. Timoney.
