A Gardeners Chronicle reader living in Grantham, Lincs, kindly offered to cooperatewith me in studying praying mantis as a pest control in the cold greenhouse. Of thedozen Spanish mantis sent him by post on June 22, only two or three survived thejourney; one thrived and the latest report I have is that this mantis is still alive.
