There was still an ease in our conversation, but its scope was restricted. I felt that Icould hardly make the usual enquiries and comments about Nigel's various mistressesas I was accustomed to whenever I saw him, much as I wondered which of his girlswas in favour at the moment. And I suppose he felt the same. We had only a fewdrinks, then decided to bathe and dress for a rather early dinner.
