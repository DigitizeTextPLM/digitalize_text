The main disadvantage of the clay pot is its brittle nature; even with reasonably carefulhandling, the annual losses are often around 10 per cent., and where the handling andstorage facilities are not too good, these losses will be even greater. This does notnecessarily apply to the larger sizes, as they are not quite so fragile as the smaller onesand are not normally thrown about in quite the same way.
