AFTER ten days of intermittent, near fatal ennui, the eleventh Berlin InternationalFilm Festival was suddenly jolted back to life by two extraordinary films, Bern-hard Wicki's &quot;Das Wunder des Malachias&quot; (&quot;The Miracle of Father Malachias&quot;) andMichaelangelo Antonioni's &quot;La Notte.&quot; The number of German film directors whohave made first rate works in the last 25 years can be counted on the fingers of one hand: Frank Wysbar (&quot;Fa&quot;hrmann Maria&quot;), Helmut Ka&quot;utner (&quot;Die Grosse Frei-heit No. 7&quot;), Herbert Selpin (&quot;Titanic&quot;), Wolfgang Staudte (&quot;Rotation&quot;), and GeorgKlaren (&quot;Wozzeck&quot;).
