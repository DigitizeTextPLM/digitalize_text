His voice was like his black and pin-stripe, a grey superimposition of respectabilityover the original colour of his own natural vowels, the result being somehow as in-effective, not just dusty-grey but muddy, slimy even. His digressions too, seemed tohave no other purpose than the throwing of dust in his client's eyes, the dust of fakesecurity, of the fake friend of the family, like the puffs from his Gauloises, which said'Don't you worry your fluffy little head about that, just lull back in the layers of myexperience,' as he told her how he had saved one of his clients from buying a housein which he somehow owned all the bricks and mortar but not the joists, which hadbeen omitted from the Deeds, and how he had learnt from another client who wasa greengrocer that all greengrocers cheat the income-tax by a complicated system ofunrecorded purchases which has become the norm at Covent Garden.
