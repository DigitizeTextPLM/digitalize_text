There is, however, a danger that workers will rely too much on fixed devices becausethey fail to recognise their limitations. It is therefore safer both in principle andpractice to keep the worker away from overhead lines wherever possible, e.g., by (1)re-routing the line, (2) putting the supply underground, (3) making the line dead (afterconsultation with the supply authority), (4) providing barriers at a safe distance toprevent vehicles from approaching the line, or height gauges or &quot;goal posts&quot; at pointswhere vehicles must pass below the line, (5) providing look-out men or banksmen.
