Questions about marriage and children were again included, as they had been at the1911 and 1951 Censuses. The former had asked for marriage details for all marriedwomen, the latter for all married women under the age of 50. The 1961 Censusquestions related to all women who were or had been married, and so repeated theenquiry made fifteen years earlier by the 1946 Family Census conducted on behalf ofthe Royal Commission on Population.
