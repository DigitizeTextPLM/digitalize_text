Such reversed migrations are known for Acartia clausi, A. longiremis, Nyctiphanescouchii, Evadne sp., Oithona nana, Daphnia lumholzi, Stages 4, 5, and adult of Calanusfinmarchicus, Diaptomus banforanus, and Cyclops bicuspidatus. An echo-producinglayer, which the authors think probably consists of euphausiids, has also been describedas, in part, regularly moving in a reverse manner. Most of these records are wellsubstantiated and involve whole populations rather than aberrant individuals.
