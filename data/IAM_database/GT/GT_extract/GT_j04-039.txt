In the preliminary experiments, the tracer was added to a liter of effluent and imme-diately coprecipitated with strontium sulphate from hot solution. Chemical exchangewas complete under these conditions; but when the tracer was added to alkaline ef-fluent and allowed to stand for several days before the addition of lead carrier, therecovery of lead-210 was as much as five per cent low when corrected for gravimetricrecovery of the carrier.
