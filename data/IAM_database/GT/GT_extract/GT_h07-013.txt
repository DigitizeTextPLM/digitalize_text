These figures are much higher than the national averages, and may be thought toindicate a lack of balance in some of the towns. On the other hand these groupsoffer fairly varied opportunities of skilled employment and are highly diversified asregards products, markets and methods of manufacture. Consumer goods industriessuch as the manufacture of food and drink, tobacco, clothing and footwear are under-represented in the new towns generally though not in Basildon and Welwyn.
