Meanwhile Mr. Moncrieff had sent me an egg-case of the Chinese mantis. The firstmantis had hatched from the very large egg-case on June 6. Both the Chinese andSpanish mantis, in the young stage at any rate, are light brown in colour. Because ofthe cool, wet weather, I had great difficulty in breeding fruit flies and, after many ofthe mantis of both types had died in my Kilner jars, I poured living mantis over vinesand peachtrees.
