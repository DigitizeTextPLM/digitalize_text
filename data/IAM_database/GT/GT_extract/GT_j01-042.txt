Unless it is known at what oxygen potential a given material in the sodium coolantcircuit will start to oxidise the cell can only be used as has been suggested above, asan oxygen concentration monitor. However, if a material oxidizes in sodium at a givenoxygen potential the reference electrode could be held at that potential and oxidizingor reducing conditions in the coolant circuit for that material would be indicated bya negative or positive potential at the reference electrode.
