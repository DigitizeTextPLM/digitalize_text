I suggested to the congregation that it needed warming up by constant prayer andworship, and we found many to help. Gifts of candlesticks and stained-glass lancetwindows - finally a new altar - helped to furnish the chapel as a little sanctuary forprayer and quiet. In time we received similar gifts for the High Altar, and large Eastand West windows.
