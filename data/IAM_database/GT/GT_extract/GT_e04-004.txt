Start by making the two side frames from 1 in. by 1 1/4 in. planed timber as shownin Fig. 1. Although the timber will have already been machine planed, remember togo over each piece with a smoothing plane, otherwise the marks left by the cutterswill show up after painting. The dimensions given enable the feeding tray to slideover a 30 in. table, but the height can be altered if required.
