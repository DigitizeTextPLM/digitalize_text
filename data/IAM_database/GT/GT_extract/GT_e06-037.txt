The East Anglian behaviour (see p. 82) has always differed from that of the summerfisheries. There is the &quot;swim&quot; at slack waters, even in daylight sometimes; and thehigh swimming, when fish are caught only in the top few yards of netting. These andother fascinating behaviour mysteries are peculiar to this fishery, which unfortunatelyseems to be dying out; but a full discussion of them is beyond the present scope.
