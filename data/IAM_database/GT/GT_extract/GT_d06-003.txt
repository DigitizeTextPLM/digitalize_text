Even worse is to laugh. Tremendous damage may be done to a child by laughing atwhat are very real fears. As adults, we know that their fears are groundless, indeed tous they appear laughable, but to a child they are very real. Not that I am suggestingthat children should be molly-coddled - they must be made to face their fears, to seethrough them and come out on the other side as victors.
