I could meet you at the bus station.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; I said, &quot;outside your office.&quot; I couldnot endure the thought of another wait at the bus station. He was there punctually.Dressed in a loud tartan shirt and abbreviated shorts he looked hardly more than aboy, a cheerful, good-natured boy. He settled me into the car with touching care andthen drove like a fiend along the river road.
