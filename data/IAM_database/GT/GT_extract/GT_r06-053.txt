Some grim comic relief was provided by an elderly farm labourer out for a shoot whohid himself in a bush and imitated a blackbird. Unfortunately a sporting taxi-driverwas after this very bird and shot the farm-labourer in the face. All, however, endedwell, reported the paper, since the pellets were easily removed and the labourer wasable to return to work the same afternoon.
