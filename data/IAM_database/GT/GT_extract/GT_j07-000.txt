This resulted in units of much lighter weight than could be obtained with tubularconstructions. The growth of the aircraft industry brought even greater emphasis tothe need for lightweight compact heat exchangers. During the 1930's, the secondarysurface plate-and-corrugation construction became established for aero-engine radia-tors, using dip-soldered copper. The air and engine-coolant passages were separatedby flat plates.
