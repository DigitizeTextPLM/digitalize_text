The libretto, by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman, is largely a satire on the pettycourt surrounding an ageing poet, whose deeply egocentric character leads him tosacrifice everything to his need of inspiration. Henze obtains his musical characteri-sation by means of individual instrumental timbres and &quot;personal&quot; intervals, and theresult is often less delineation of character than caricature. This is also the chief, orat least the most successfully executed trait of the libretto, which contains an oddblend of highly poetic phraseology and schoolboy humour.
