Ben Zoma said: "The days of 1thy life means in the day-time; all the days of 1thylife means even at night-time." (Berochoth.) And the Rabbis thought it importantthat when we read the Shmah "to be willing to hear," we should remember the GreatDeliverance: Passover and its connection with the fringes (the tsitsits).
