BELMONDO reappears at the Paris Pullman in Moderato Cantabile (curiously trans-lated into Seven Days... Seven Nights ... A certificate), Peter Brook's film made inFrance and shown last autumn at the London Film Festival. In spite of magnificentperformances from him and from Jeanne Moreau, this has been fairly well trouncedby the critics wherever it has appeared. Leisurely, even slow, rhythmically repetitive,the mysteriously simple story takes place on the banks of the Garonne, which becomesan unforgettable image.
