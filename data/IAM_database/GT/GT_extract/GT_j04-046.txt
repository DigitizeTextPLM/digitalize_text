The presence and growth of algae in the alkaline effluent does not prevent the recoveryof radio-lead under the prescribed conditions although some radioactivity remains onthe algae until the metathesis has been completed by heating the mixed sulphateswith three separate portions of dilute (1.25 normal) sodium carbonate solution. Thestrength of the carbonate solution was chosen after experiments with lead tracer alonewhich indicated that less lead was lost than at other concentrations.
