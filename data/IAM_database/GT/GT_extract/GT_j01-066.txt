The probe can be evacuated and filled with inert gas via the tube L which must ofcourse be electrically isolated after this has been carried out. It is not suggested thatthe above proposal will be successful but rather that it is worth a trial in the event ofthe inadequacy of some simpler method of monitoring the oxygen in a sodium circuit.The principal difficulty encountered by the author, in determining partial molal freeenergies by solid electrolyte cells of very stable oxides such as UO2, MnO etc. wasvapour phase transfer of oxygen by carbonaceous impurities in the blanket gas.
