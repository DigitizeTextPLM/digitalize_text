First of all simple part-songs: I found only one member who had any idea of readingmusic. This was the village doctor who was an old school friend at Clifton. He couldsustain the tenor part quite well and lead the others. As for basses and altos theconductor had to teach by singing the parts with them. It was very amusing, and bythe end of a few months an enthusiastic choir of men and women could render simplepart-singing tolerably well.
