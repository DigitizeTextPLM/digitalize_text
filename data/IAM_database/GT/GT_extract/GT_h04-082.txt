For this fairly small group, comparisons between different years cannot be made soprecisely as in groups with a defined number of children. In 1959 the householdsin this group contained slightly more children (average 4.64) than in the previousyear (average 4.53). Their total food expenditure increased less than that in othergroups, and they purchased more of certain foods such as fish, poultry, eggs, cannedvegetables, fresh fruit, chocolate biscuits and breakfast cereals which, in general, aremore expensive sources of nutrients than those foods of which they purchased less,namely dried milk, potatoes, carcase meat, sugar, bread, flour and oatmeal and oatproducts.
