This last objection might have had some weight in ecclesiastical circles. In his NaturalHistory, 13.11-12, the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making. As Plinywas killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeiiin A.D. 79, his information is contemporaneous with the New Testament. The otherform of book was the codex. In this the sheets were bound together down one edgemuch as they are in modern books.
