The chine is the long stringer on each side which is joined to both transoms and liesin the grooves cut in the moulds. Each chine is made of oak, ash, spruce or any longgrained flexible wood. I prefer spruce when available. As will be seen in the plan, thetransoms have a frame 1 in. by 1 in. on each side.
