This loss is acceptably small for an analytical step when no correction for carrierrecovery is possible. The completeness of the chemical exchange between the bismuth-210 and the added carrier was also tested. Two samples of precipitated lead chromate(lead-210, bismuth-210) were counted and dissolved in nitric acid in silica basins. Thecontents were evaporated to dryness with bismuth carrier and then taken up in 2 Nhydrochloric acid and the ion exchange separation completed.
