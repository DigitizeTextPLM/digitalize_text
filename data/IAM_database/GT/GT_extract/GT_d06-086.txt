The housewife would find life far less tiring if she made a list, followed a routineof work rather than getting from one thing to the next. The business man wouldfind that he reached the end of the day with far less strain if he was a little moresystematic. To drift aimlessly along is more wearying than anything else. If we wouldonly sit down and write out all the necessary jobs waiting to be done and then workquietly through them, we would find life considerably less exhausting - and in the endwe would do more.
