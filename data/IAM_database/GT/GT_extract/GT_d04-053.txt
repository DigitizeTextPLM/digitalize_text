Freedom from want cannot be fulfilled nor freedom from fear, fear of starvation inthe midst of plenty. Help will not be easily forthcoming for the people in need. Theywill think of the animals first (which is of course our duty). Of course the individualwill eat and be full but: &quot;Take heed to yourself, that your heart be not deceived, and1ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them&quot;, the yourself is thy greatestenemy, the self-seeking self.
