We went straight to bed and slept until the turtle-doves drummed up the sun. Thenext morning, in the square opposite Pierre's, I read about the Nice beach catastrophein the Patriote. Mart had been right, the body had been a woman's. It belonged toa Madame N. Enquiries had been made in the neighbourhood, and it transpired thatMadame N's husband had made an arrangement with the dead lady's sister to launchher into the strong sea and there be left to perish.
