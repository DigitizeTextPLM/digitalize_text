There may be some who will argue that routine destroys the soul. It is so easy, theysay, to get into a rut. Save us from the school curriculum and even worse the schoolsystem whereby for meals everybody knows beforehand exactly what, on any givenday of the week, they are going to have. If - such a critic may say - you are callingus to adventure, do not strangle us before we start by putting us into a strait-jacketcalled 'order'.
