At the end of five days, bismuth-210 will have reached one-half of its equilibriumvalue and can be counted through an aluminium absorber sufficiently thick to stopthe beta particles from lead-210 and the alpha particles from polonium-210. Earlierbeta counting is permissible but the sensitivity of the method is reduced (See Fig. 4).The presence of other lead nuclides may be demonstrated by observing the ingrowthof the bismuth activity and comparing the shape of the normalised curve with thecurve in Fig. 4. using an arbitrary scale of activity proportional to the existingordinate.
