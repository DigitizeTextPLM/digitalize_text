No. I'm not your type. I'd make you miserable. I mean that. I'd very probably beunfaithful and that'd kill you. Then I'd be unfaithful too, to teach you a lesson. Itwouldn't work. You'd do it to spite me. I would never do it for that reason. To meit'd be immaterial whether you'd retaliate or not. You'd go crazy if that situationarose.
