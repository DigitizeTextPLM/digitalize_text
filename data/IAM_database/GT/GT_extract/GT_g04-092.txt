It was quite amusing to see how much the children enjoyed the service, and I heardof parents or faithful nurses threaten any naughty child with the penalty of not beingallowed to come to the Children's Church on Sunday afternoon. I hope the threatkept them good in the week, but anyway they were a most delightful lot, and it is agreat joy to meet them now fifty years afterwards when so many are parents or evengrandparents, and one of the present churchwardens and several officials of the churchstill remember those days.
