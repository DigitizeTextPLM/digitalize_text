Clean up with the plane ready for the bottom, which is cut in one piece. It shouldoverlap just a trifle; this can be cleaned up later. As you are screwing and gluing thispiece to the chines it is necessary to be careful not to miss the chine with the screws.I prefer spacing screws 3 in. apart for the bottom, both for screwing to the chinesand the bottom shaped transom facing.
