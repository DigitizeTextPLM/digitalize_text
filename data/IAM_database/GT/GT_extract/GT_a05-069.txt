It was the end of a rather curious speech in which Mr. Macmillan wound up thetwo-day debate on foreign affairs. He began in a low, almost chatty monotone, andhis voice never rose to any accent of urgency. He passed in rapid review the UnitedNations Secretariat; nuclear tests; the canard about British interference with theUnited Nations in the Congo; Kuwait; and South-East Asia.
