In the days when most people were born, lived and died within the boundaries ofthe village, it was not difficult for anybody to live a day at a time. Even those whoheld a high and responsible office lived in far greater simplicity than their successors.When news from the Continent took days, from America weeks, from the Far East,months, even a Prime Minister could go to sleep in blissful ignorance of what mightbe happening at the other end of England, whereas today, everybody, let alone thePrime Minister, knows of happenings the other side of the world, within minutes oftheir taking place.
