In view of its well-known normal migration, the occurrence of Calanus finmarchicusin the summer at the surface in bright sunlight may justly be considered anoma-lous. This phenomenon has nevertheless been recorded many times, and such surfaceCalanus may be present in enormous numbers, breaking the surface into small circu-lar ripples like raindrops. Observed underwater, two zones of differing behavior wererecognized: an upper one about 30 cm in depth, in which the Calanus swam up anddown repeatedly, frequently bumping on the undersurface of the water, and a lowerone of indeterminate depth in which animals swam directly up or down.
