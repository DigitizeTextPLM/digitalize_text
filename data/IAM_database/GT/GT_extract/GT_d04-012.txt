The word Shamir was used as a personal name (Git. 68a). The Hebrew word&quot;SHAMIR&quot; means guarded or preserved. Therefore, the real man, who regards him-self as insignificant, as the prayer says: &quot;What am I? A worm&quot;, he is the Shamir andsuch a man fulfils the Shmah, loves the Lord God with all his heart, and with all hissoul and with all his might and studies the word of God.
