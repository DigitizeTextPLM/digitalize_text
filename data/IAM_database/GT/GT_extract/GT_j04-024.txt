Rosenquist (4) showed that minute quantities of lead can be isolated from large vol-umes of solution by coprecipitating the lead with a strontium sulphate. Lead andstrontium form mixed crystals so that the more insoluble lead sulphate is almostcompletely recovered even if precipitation of the strontium sulphate is incomplete.Using ten milligrams of lead carrier and six hundred milligrams of strontium perliter, more than 95 experiment.
