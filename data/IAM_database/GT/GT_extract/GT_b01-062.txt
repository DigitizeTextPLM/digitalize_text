Should the Herald publish such advertisements? This is a difficult question. It wouldobviously be wrong to refuse all political advertisements with which we disagree.When an advertisement contains statements whose factual truth is doubtful, or wherethe total content would be deeply repugnant to our readers, it is right to exerciseeditorial discretion. The MRA advertisement falls into neither category, though manyreaders will dislike it.
