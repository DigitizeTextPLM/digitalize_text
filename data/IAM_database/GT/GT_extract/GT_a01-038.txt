Mr. Macleod thought the two Rhodesian parties had refused to attend the talksbecause Sir Roy had found messages sent from the Government were &quot;unsatisfac-tory.&quot; African delegates to the talks yesterday called on Mr. Macmillan to cease hisnegotiations with Sir Roy's representative, Mr. Julius Greenfield. He was at Che-quers last week-end. They said they regarded with &quot;growing anger&quot; the &quot;grossand unconstitutional&quot; interference by Sir Roy's Federal Government in the talks.
