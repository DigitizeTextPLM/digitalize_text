Then they stop swimming and are caught. In the seine-net film this usually seemedto happen just after the fish had risen above the footrope, and presumably out of itsfield of disturbance, or bow wave. This suggests that the wave might be transmittedby the sea-bed, though the footrope in this case was actually just off the bottom andwas indeed passing over some fish.
