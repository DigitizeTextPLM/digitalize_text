Polonium-210 remains on the column and does not interfere. Strontium does notform a chloro-complex and therefore passes through in the feed solution and the firstwash. The resin is used for a single separation and then thrown away. In the firststage of the analysis, only the fraction containing lead-210 is collected. The lead isprecipitated as the chromate, washed, slurried onto an aluminium counting tray, driedunder an infra-red lamp, weighed, and set aside for five days while the bismuth-210grows in.
