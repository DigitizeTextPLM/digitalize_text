The Shamir's daily life writes the Decalogue, which is written on two plates, the hardfacts of life, and all facts are &quot;one&quot;. We have all come across human Shamirs and theyleave a deep impression on our feelings and senses. They make us the Altar for Godto emit the Light which can be read in every language. The Shamir is the &quot;seventh&quot;and most important creature, that was created on the eve of the Sabbath, to bringthe Sabbath, real peace to the whole world.
