In Gethsemane He prayed that the cup should pass from Him. Jesus shows us theway to face life. To see all the latent frightening possibilities and yet by facing themand knowing God is with us and that, with Him, there is nothing that can finallydefeat us. More than that, that God has something important to do with our livesand that the nearer we get to Him, the stronger we become.
