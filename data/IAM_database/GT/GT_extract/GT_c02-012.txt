Every unnecessary detail, all superfluous local colouring must be eliminated. Hedoes not want the accuracy of a police photograph, but rather he wants to showthe eternal in every instant.&quot; The chilling horror of &quot;Malachias&quot; is due as much toWicki the photographer as to Wicki the director. His earlier film, &quot;Die Bru&quot;cke,&quot;was equally terrifying, but here the director moves out of the world of reality into anicy supernatural vacuum where the sun never shines.
