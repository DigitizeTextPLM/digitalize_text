Soil blocks are probably the oldest alternative to clay pots for plant raising. These arecompressed blocks of compost, made in a specially devised press to simulate roughlythe shape and size of a pot. Usually cylindrical or hexagonal in shape, they are madeof the same compost as would have been used in a pot, the only difference being thatit is used in a slightly moister condition.
