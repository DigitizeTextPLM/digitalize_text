I can't recall a production where so many comics bolted in and out of holes so often.The jokes were a reshuffle of the same old lot - this time Brian Rix lost his skirt insteadof his trousers. The action moved at tremendous speed, backed by some wonderfultiming by the cast. I especially liked the tea-cup scene where six of the cast changedcups with the dexterity of Chinese jugglers.
