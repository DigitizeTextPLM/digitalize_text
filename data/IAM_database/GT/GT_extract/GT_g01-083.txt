A sum of 160,000 was demanded - a staggering figure to mediaeval eyes. It was deter-mined that 100,000 was a fairer target, and the Parliament agreed to find two-thirdsof this sum providing the clergy supplied the remainder. The method of assessmentto which the Commons agreed was that of the first poll-tax. The manifest injustice ofthis method had been to a certain degree corrected by the sliding scale of the secondpoll-tax, but this lesson was ignored, and the injustice trebled in weight by a flat-ratetax at treble the rate - every adult had to pay three groats, but this time an adultwas re-defined as anyone over fifteen.
