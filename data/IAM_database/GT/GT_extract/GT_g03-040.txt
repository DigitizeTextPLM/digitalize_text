As they became known the Choir went to working-men's clubs, to Conisborough oncheap trips to sing to the miners, and sang for other organisations such as the Bakers'Union, for whom they went on Saturday evenings to the Corner Pin Hotel, to rally themembers. The B.S.P. also rented pleasant rooms on West Street, where a successfulSunday school was held.
