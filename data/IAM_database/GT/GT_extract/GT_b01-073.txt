The first reaction of the Sudanese Government was to denounce the United Nationsfor &quot;negligence and impotence,&quot; and to say that its 400 troops in the Congo wouldbe taken home. The reaction can be understood. The Sudan's concern for its men isnatural. But this could hardly be a dignified exit. IF the UN is blamed for being weak,it would be more logical to send in more men, not weaken it further by desertion.
