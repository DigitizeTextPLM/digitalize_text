The Hall proved most useful, especially in winter when the distance to the churchdeterred many from coming to Sunday Evensong. We managed to furnish a tablewith cross and candles, and the people appreciated the Church Hall for worship aswell as for more secular purposes. In 1910 Dr. Talbot was translated to Winchester,and Dr. Hubert Burge became Bishop of Southwark.
