2. Mechanisms. The majority of vertical migrations undoubtedly result from activeswimming although passive movement through the water has been suggested on vari-ous grounds. For example, transport in vertical currents resulting from temperaturedifferences has been proposed; differences in water viscosity after temperature changeshave also been suggested as a cause of movement, and passive movement could possiblyresult from changes in the specific gravity of the animals as a result of feeding.
