1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-

abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists
Since the mid-twentieth centliry, the concept of information has heen a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Uineer-
tainty Reduction theory (URT), accredited to Charles RK. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication, Through the development of URT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research. Heath and Bryant (20060) state: “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 133). The study of information is basic
to all fields af communication, but its relation to the study of uncertamty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the role of communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (19745) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social peychological theories Starting points” (p. 99).
