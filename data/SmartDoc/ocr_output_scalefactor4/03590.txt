Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging field of m-
terpersonal communication and on the develogenent of WRT. Festinger is best kroner for the theories
of Cognitive DMssonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory (CT) attempted to
expiien how an imbalance among cognitions taght alleect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed COT
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, }982). CDT allerws for three
