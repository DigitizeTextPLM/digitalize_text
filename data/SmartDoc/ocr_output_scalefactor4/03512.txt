1 Conclusion: The lmportance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasewell, Ellul, and Sermays are importané for a mumber of

reasons. Based on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann was able to bring attention to the food thal

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the direct etfects and limited effects
media models, Theorists such as Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
propaganda could diret thy influence the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, theorists euch as Lippmann
also noted that the media might not be influencing only thought, but may also be influencing what
people thought about. It was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting Point for future research
in the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work of
Iyengar and Kinder, as well as WeCombs and Shaw. Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in
this paper haa been very important to the understanding of the media, the manipulation of the public,
and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul
were formed years ago, they continue to help us understand the society that surrounds us today.
