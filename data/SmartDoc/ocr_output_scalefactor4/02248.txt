It is well accepted that communication thearies have developed through the realms of psychology and sa-
ciology over the past 100 years, With Illumed by valuable ideas a well as exploring more untilled fields in these
two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding media. As a sub-tradition of
media effects research, ies and gratifications approach Is suggested to be originally stemmed from a func-
tionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974]. To same extent, however, functional theory
on communication agrees with media's eHfects towards people, For example, a madel often used in the the-
ary, the Hypadermic Syringe modal, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential
effect upan audiences by ‘injecting’ information into the consciousness of the masses” (Watson & Hill 1957, p.
205). Functional theory influenced studies an communication from the 1970s ta the 1940s, After that, a shift
which rediscovernd the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses
and gratiications approach,

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almast as ald as
empirical mass cammunication research itself (hcQuail, 1983}, Dating back to the 1940s, regearchers became
Interested in the reasons for viewing diferent radia programmes, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well
as daily newspaper (Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc.). In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium
itself (Katz et al., 1974b}. For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy thelr listeners with advice,
support, or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure to the daily routine [Berebon, 1549). For these diverse dimensians of usage
catisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the tate 1950s till 1970s when television has grawn
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars whe focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociolagist and as a communication researcher He received his PhO, in So-
ciology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. in the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication fram the 1570s tol990s (UPENM, 2001). In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its

aperimerntal Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Katz's mentor in Columbia University i Paul Lazarsfeld, who is one of the pioneers of gratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that conmect the concept of gratifications with the
functional thesry model Later, Katz introduced uses and gratticaton approach when he came up with the
notign that people use the media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject

by which individuals conmect of disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to
their needs more readily than the media qverpower them (Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumer, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 which
were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication, They taak amore humanistic approach to looking at media
use. They suggest that media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the user and
they have alternate choices to satisfy their need. (Blumler & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that media
served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission for both society
and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974).
