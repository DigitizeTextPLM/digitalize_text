played a considerable role in influenc ing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider,
Kelley, and Hovland. By the 197s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction,
relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such schalars
as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the decade

Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal comm research
agenda during the past two decades” (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus
eit dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as
a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically
focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. [t has heen recognized
that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).
Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has
contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus
on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication, Their work
is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our
understanding of interpersonal processes.

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of commu-
nication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined
and studied. Qne way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there
was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
also contributed ta the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the
‘nformation theorists as well as Heider (1958) research in attribution, Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as
the “number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave” (p. 100). The greater the
level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to pre-
dict behaviors and occurrences. During Interactions indivicuals are not only facecl with problems of
predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or beliewe in the way
that they da. Berger and Bradae's (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this
process when they stated: “Uncertaincy, then, can stem from te large numbel ol alternative things
that a stranger can believe or potentially say" Uncertainty plays a significant rale une examiuillng
relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely in hibit relational dla tana Uncertainty can
couse stress and anxiety which can lead to low levels of comm unicator competence (West & Tumer,
20). Incompetent communicators may not be able to develop relationships or she Es toa annxadrus
to engage in initial interactions. West and Turner (2000) note that lower levels of une Se
ink reased verbal and nonverbal behavior, increased levels of intimacy, and increased em sa
actions individuals are expected to increase predictability with the goal that this will vais to the ability
tict and explain what will oocur in future interactions. When high uncertainty exists it is often
eae reach this goal, Although individuals seek to reduce uncertainty, high levels of certainty
Be airraeilty can also inhibit a relationship. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “Too much certainty

and predictability can deaden a relationship;
