I. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

z Five basic assumptions were stated ina study of K
Chey provide a framework for understanding thi

al, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows.
the correlation between media and audiences:

iS

definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience
member.

2. In the mass communication process much initiative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on

theorizing about amy form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and
behavior.

3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
mass communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs,
and the depree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consump-
tion certainly varies.

4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- Le., people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in
particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be

suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms. (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumer, and Gurevitch also commented that, although aie ee

pratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people on the media, they did mot a ee s
