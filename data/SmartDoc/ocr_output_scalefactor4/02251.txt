Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure pba ects
inguisti two levels, the systematic system an Vv
To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on
by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the ae ake <a
af conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the maternal of the sig nal whic. ‘ page ;
it, as opposed to it, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language is binge ah
p.13). Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure

langue, isthe social convention or value shared through a society which is sla bilized and standardized.
On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However,

it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the
shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of
language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one
wishes to communicate. lt is because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is

essentially a combinative activity that it cormesponds to and individual act and not to a pure
creation, (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Facusing on tne systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the
signifiad and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, bath the word
Gog In English or in Korean are the external farms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual

animal, ine concept in question, becomes the signified. “| propose to retain the word Sign (signe) ta

matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible sig ns that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various Possibilities in Selecting the signs within th
Same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the Consensus of linguistic communi z
