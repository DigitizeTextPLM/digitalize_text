1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first

ous criticisms of the text, not least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about “the
commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and failed to examine the culture ind ustry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48),

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant idealogy, be-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pe rvasive reification” (Eagleton,
1991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys-
tem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adarno's idea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the 1960s
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the: 19405
While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial 2a
eties between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (rohendahl,
