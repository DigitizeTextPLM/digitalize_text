1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding;

7. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;

3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, status,

4, Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends; and

6. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.
