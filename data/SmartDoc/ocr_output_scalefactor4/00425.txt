exalted chronologically, from its pre-conditions, through its generation, to its subsequent impact. The idea of

production of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music, but also to Hollywood
movies. That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies.

Adomo was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin
never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno
became in effect Benjamins only pupil. After Benjamin’s death “it was Adomo who then introduced a rational-
ined version of his idess into academic philosophy.” (Jager, 2004, p. 65-5). The relationship with Benjamin had

an impact on the development of Adomoes thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adore began
teaching at the Institute. Adome lost his fight to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi
party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began
operating there. The Nazis rise to power not only meant that Adomo Lost his jab and would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jirgen Habermas would later mate, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe-
riences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the prostuction
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 45),

dome was at Cecdford from 1994 te 1938, where he worked on a ma
an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he lk i forward to joining his Fra
furt School collearues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States Already in the late
19306 Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during he
1930s, Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture, since film and rade hecame the two most popular anes
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. | he essay translated as “Om the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age ot Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). 4 pri-
mary problem for Adome lay im the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonié works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records, The result was inferior to the
original, and Adamo was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduce of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music und the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adomo, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes Hed to class, to Adomo, the aura of the original artwork was the
agsential of the artistic authenticity, To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
quthority of Platonic onder from the top-the original or Idea- to down of layers of imitations; to Adora, a
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The gemeral allitwee o8 tt 1 arae t .
