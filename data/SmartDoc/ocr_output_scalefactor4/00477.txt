: According ta Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu-
DIGated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
18 an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption, The diffu-
et of Innowations invelves beth mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 4(7%).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu-
hicalion people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, $-M-C-R-E
(e.g, sender-message-channel-receiver-effect), Rogers (195) mentioned, “this S-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19), Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a soci) system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, “Time” variable
is a very important factor, According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innowativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inna-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted ta explain fhe variahles
that influence how and why users and audience adopt a new information medium, suchas the Internet.
