the concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of Indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts” (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis
fed.), o. 37). The comespondence of the conceptimeaning ta the extemal fanm is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation but the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that “language does
not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, bul constructs meaning from
within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences’, According to Saussure, “meaning
is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic
(e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g. synonyms), organized into a signifying system" (Barker,
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection Is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the follow-
ing sentence: "| went to a theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence ts established through ihe
linear combination of signs, The signs within the example, such as | theater, my, and girlfriend eke
substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as “She wentto a restaurant with a pe
Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated on a :
