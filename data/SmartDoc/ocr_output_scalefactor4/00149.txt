1. CRITICAL RESPONSE TO “THE CULTURE INDUSTRY"

He complained to the dean about the radical students in his classes who were making
teaching impossible. In the winter tenm of 1968-69 students occupied a number of buildings
at the University at Frankfurt, including the Institute for Social Research. After the strike
ended, Adorno returned to teaching, but his lectures continued to be disrupted, including
one “tasteless demonstration” in which three females bared their breasts. Adomo died a few
months later (Jager, 2004, p. 201-08).

1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culture industry outside of a German context. In the years since there have been mumer-
ous criticisms of the text, not least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about “the
earmmodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adomo erred in not discussing the processes af cul-
tural production, and failed to examine the cultura industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adormo and Marcuse overestimated the dominant idealagy, be-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton,
1691, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant Values and beliefs
among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction af the sys-
tem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p, 36). Fredric Jamesan pointed out that Adorno’s idea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the 1960s
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1940s.
While the idea of the culture industry can be defanded as a useful theory for industrial soci-
eties between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl,
4995, p. 146-48). Thus, for a some critics, the value of the idea of the cultura industry would
appear to be merely historical, if they in fact canceded that it had any value al all.

Thus for some critics modernist works would be counteracting forces against the daminant
ideology. As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, il may be the case that the
dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of the cultura
industry has had an importance in critical theory since its appearance in the 1940s, in that
it has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation to ideology, and
hence, society, Since Adore made sweeping generalizations about the impact of the culture
industry, and sinca he did not systematically explore how the culture industry operated, it has
been generally easy for some to dismiss the idea of a culture industry. It is nonetheless the
cage that motion pictures are still made by large companies and that their movies largely rely
on formulale plats. Itis also the cage that radio is increasingly controlled by a small nurrikeer
ef companies, which tend to impose restrictions on how stations operate. As a broadcast
medium, television is very much related to both radio and film, and shares with them qualities
that situation it in the culture industry. While there is a democratizing aspect to the Intemaet
fin that amyone can create a web site), it happens that the commercial companies operating
on fhe Intemet continue ta maintain an ideological function. For example, one seldom sees
new stores on MSNBC or Yahoo that would question the prerogatives of corporate America.

A reexamination of the idea of the culture industry may be necessary in order to theorize on
how mass communication media propagate dominant ideologies.
