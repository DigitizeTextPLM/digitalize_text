1. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLI GHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in
Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative
in Europe. The closest thing in Adornos experience to the advertising industry in the United States
was fascist propaganda (Jager, 2004, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience with
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did
not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adornos dissatisfaction with
the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop
the idea of the culture industry.

Because of the relationship betueen the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University,
Horkheimer, who had already moved to California, could not bring Adorno to the West Coast until
November 1941. When Adorne was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate community that
included Frits Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Bisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Déblin, and
Bertolt Brecht, several of which found work in the Hollywood mowie industry. The faet that Adorno
was part of this intellectual community whose members were involved in the production of Hollywood
movies must have lod some influence in developing Ais Hhoughts on culture, since the Hollywood system.
inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany.

These preconditionsAdornos interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvernent with the expatriate community in California and the

relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important to an understanding of
his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother ta present itself ag art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl

1995, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adornawere the Hollywood production system, or

the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies

amd hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula suppl
pplants the work (Horkheimer and Ad
2002, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the Fens
