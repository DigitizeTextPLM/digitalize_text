Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Losewell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of

the public is able to be influenced by the medic. The werk of Lippmann and his colleagnes haa led to more
