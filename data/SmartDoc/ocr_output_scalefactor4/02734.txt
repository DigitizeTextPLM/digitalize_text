Rogers was bom in Carroll, lowa in 1931, He eamed his B.A., M.A.. and Ph.D. degrees from lowa
State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S, Air Force. Interestingly,
in 1966, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea.

: The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creats applications of diffu-
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously
mentioned, communication, Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was
suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2008,

According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu-
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
sion of innovations invelves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication of mass commu-
Nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, §-M-(-R-E
(e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-cffect}. Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this 5-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19), Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, “Time’ variable
is a very important factor, According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innevation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted fo explain the wariahles
that influence how and why users and audience adopt a new information median, such ag the Internet.
According to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even fhowge in the
past the individual is weually the unit of analysis. A feo, critical mass hecomes an important factor in
adopting new media becouse new media are interactive tools and thus are required! iy meaty users ta
gain efficiency. Thar is, the mare people use, the more people get benefits. Ine this sense, aliffuxiont

theory not only can apply te practical things, but also can be related to digital divide.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innevativeness:
“(1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (3) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. LEST H). Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system" (Rogers, 1995, p. 40), Figure 1 shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories
follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped. Source by wavw2.gsu.edu! weewite/docaldit

a S-shaped curve, However, as noted above, different types of innovations {e.6., the rate of ee
adoption is faster than that of the hybrid seed com} can have their own different rates in diffusion. t ig:

ceptiO2.htral When it comes to the process of innovation-decisions, Rogers (1995) mentioned that

there are five stages.
|. Knowledge + or — (selective exposure or awareness of mews)

2. Attitudes + or — (people have positive or negative altitude toward innovations)
in

3. Adoption (Decision): people decide to adopt the innovation

4, Implementation (regular or standard practice)

5, Confirmation (comparing and evaluating}
