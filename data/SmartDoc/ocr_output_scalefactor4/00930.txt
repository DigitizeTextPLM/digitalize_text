I, OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1 Other Propaganda Theorists
1.1 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

s Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In

fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself
(Rogers, 1994). : :

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on

conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda,
and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswell is credited with creating
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis can be
defined as, "...the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classifications
in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled "Contents of Communication,’

Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain

symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and

the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to

achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence that runs from control to content and trom content

to audience" (p. 7-4).

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1955) ear ly definition of communication which
stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" (p. 44). Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a let of work within this area during the
remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also inter sted in how propaganda could
shape public opinion, This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system, In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public jis limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it. However, It is still that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government This is an interesting way of Viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann s turer

1.2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1991-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays (1928)
defines propaganda as. a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence Une relations of a
public to am enter prise, idea, or group (p- 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bemays recognizes
that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful te aie public. It can help individuals decide what to think
ahout or alter the opinions af individuals, but this may actually be benetic ial to seeclety's fumecchonimg a5 4 wile,

Raced on these ideas that the public opinion can be modified, and that such shaping 15 a necessary part of
