Lael ooh Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further develo ee
Lewin’s theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging field of in
terpersonal communication and on the development of URT, Festinger is best known for the theories
oft Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison, Cognitive Dissonance theary (CDT) allempbed to
explain how aun imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed Coy
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 982). COT allows for three
relationships to occur among cognitions: a consenant relationship, in which cognitions are in equi-
librium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each
other; and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another
(West & Turner, 2000). Cognitive Dissonance, like unceriainty, has an element of arousal and dis-
comfort that individuals seck to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to
feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual
usually secks the opinions of others who ore similar to the self. This need for social comparison can
result in conformity pressures (Trenholm && Jensen, 2004). Berger and Calabrese (1975) related so-
cial comparison to URT by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons seek out similar others
who are proximate when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of
their behavior and/or opinions in @ particular situation” (p. 107), Festinger received the Distinguished
Scientist award of the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Senior Scientist
Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger’s legacy is significant, and
his theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research. Aronson in
Festinger, 1980) stated, “It was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed Bee Hein 2
cownitive digsonance, and in my opinion, social psychology has not been the same since” (p. 2).
