bers, Blumer and Katz (1974) concluded th

sage for very different purposes. The same media content may erati

individuals. There is not only one way that people uses ible is!

ing the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, . f

i ee needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, hesiope le

education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet thelr

needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives ane gratifications

for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of media-person

interactions" to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or

problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal

identity: self reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance (farms of informe-
| tion seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience’s motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based
on a general theory of human needs, He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus
“internal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
) these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch and Haas
| (1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
put them inte five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding;

2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;

. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, status;
. Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends; and

oe

. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.
Congruously, McQluail’s (1983) classification of the following commen reasons for media use:

* finding out about relevant events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society and the
world

* seeking advice on practical matters or opinion and decision choices
« satisfying curiosity and general interest
* learning; self-education

* gaining a sense of security through knowledge

* finding reinforcement for personal values
* finding models of behavior
* identifying with valued others (in the media)

* gaining insight into oneself
