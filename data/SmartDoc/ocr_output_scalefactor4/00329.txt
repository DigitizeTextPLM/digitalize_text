L. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

ates had gone far beyond anything he had acen in
Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something pan ni bape
in Europe. The closest thing in Adornos experience to the advertising industry in fc] ui fe
was fascist propaganda (Jager, 2004, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to hts experience te
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the rie aleLils

division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Lagarsfeld and Adorno a
not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adornos dissatisfaction wi

the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop
the idea of the culture industry. at

Because of the relationship between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University,
Horkheimer, who had already moved to California, could not bring Adorno to the West Const unit
November 1941. When Adorno was finally able fo relocate, he joined an expatriate commurnaty that
included Frit: Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Bisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Doblin, and
Bertolt Brecht, several of which found work in the Hollywood movie industry. The fact that Adorne
wos port of this intellectual community whose members were involved in the production af Hollywood
movies must have had some influence in developing his thoughts on culture, since the Hollywood system
inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Wermar Germany.

These preconditionsAdornos interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the
relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important to an understanding of
his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itselfas art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitalism. in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendah]
1985, p. 142), Examples of thisnot specified by Adornowere the Hollywood production system or
the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno
2002, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any Teal change to the seston.
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002
Ii-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the aysbem, and Adorno cited eee Westies
as an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would
allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it tneffact al
