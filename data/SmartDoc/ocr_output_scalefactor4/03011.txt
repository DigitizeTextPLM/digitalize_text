Rogers was born in Carroll, lowa in 1931. He earned his B_A., M.A., and Ph.D. alae setae
State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served In me U.S. Air Force. Interestingly,
in 1966, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea. aa =

The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it reais applications sagas
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously
mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico tn 2004 because he was
suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005. ae

According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process hy which an Innovation 15 commu:
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).

That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass Commu-
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-C-R-E
(e.g,, sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this S-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2} message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variable

is a Very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)

the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables
that influence how and why users and audience adopt anew information medium, such as the Interne.
According to evelution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even though in the
past the individual is usually the unit of analysis. Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in
adopting new media because new media are interactive tools and thus are required By mary wsers to
gain efficiency. That is, the more peaple use, the more peaple get benefits, Ja this sense, diffusion
theory not only can apply te practical things, Aut also can be related to digttal divide. 2

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:

“) Innovators (venturesome}, (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185), R
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively ear
