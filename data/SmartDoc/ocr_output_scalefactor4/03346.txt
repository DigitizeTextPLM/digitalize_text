aa is Is $0 grows out-of a number of historical contingencies,

Adomp was introduced to Walter Henjamin in, 1923, and the two theorists became friends, Since Benjamin
never received a degree that would allow him tp teach at a university, according to Hannah Arends, Adorno
became in effect Benjamins anly pupil. After Benjamin's death “it was Adorno who then introduced a rational-
ined Version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (Jager, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had
af impact on the development of Adomos thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adore began
leaching at the Institute, Adare lost his right ta teach in September 1933 due to the rise 1 power of the Nazi
party, Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began
operating there. The Magis rise ta power not only meant that Adomo Jost his job and would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but algo affected his philosophical thought. As Flirgen Habermas would later note, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development af fascist regimes was one of the historical expe-
Fiences influencing the development of critical theary, ihe others being Stalinist repression and the production
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48).

Adorno was at Oxford fram 1934 to 1998, where be worked ona manuscript on Husserl He was considered
An Outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he locked forward te jaining his Frank-
furt School colleagues, many of whom had iin the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the late
19306 Adome evidenced litthe hope for mast culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1990s, Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture, since film and radio became the tao most popular means
io disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “Om the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's mare
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art inthe Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1349, 6. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adore lay in the fisct that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could
nmerw be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phoongraph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adore was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the mew listening help to make cocape from the whole infantil: milieu
impossible” (Adora, 2001b. p. 47), While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes thed to class, to Adomo, the aura af the original artwork was the

essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the

authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea- to down of layers of imitations, te Adorno, mass

production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school

was that of Adora. In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who bad succeeding in establishing a relationship for the

Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in

New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, ram by Paul Lazars-
feld. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although he later claimed that he did not know what s “radio project” was. For his part,
Lazarsfeld looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be am expert on musk. Adome
wrate for the Project's journal in 1941, reiterating his position that radio was only an. image of a live pertor:
mance, In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio industry that the medium was bringing serious music
to the masses (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 243}. While working at the Princeton Radio Research Project Adorna
hecame shocked at the depree to which culture had become commercialized in the United States.

Adomo was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin
never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a univeralty, according to Hnunals Arendt, Adame
became in effect Benjamins oaly pupil. After Benjamin's death “it wae si atls wha then cirodacad a rational-
«ned version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (Jager, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had
an impact on the development of Adomes thought during this period, Retuming to Frankfurt, Adomo began
teaching at the Institute, Adomo lost his right ta teach in is aul 1933 due to the rise lo power af the Nazi
party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Instiute began

operating there.
