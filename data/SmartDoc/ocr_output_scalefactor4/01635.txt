cundation, with the invelvement of George Gerbner and others. In this essay Adorno
warned, rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed

of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adore would nonetheless: on occasion attempt to reshape
his thought on the culture industry. Por example, in 1954 he wrote of a universal pseudo-calture
in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio tulk in Germany in 1963 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the esay Transparencies on Film,
