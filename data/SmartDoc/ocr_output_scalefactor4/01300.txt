Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The Big nified if a concept or meaning whieh is expressed through the San
The form is called the signifier, which is the extemal part of language. For exam ple, both the ee
dog in English orin Korean are the extemal forms ex pressing the actual animal dog, Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifid) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts” (Saussure, 1959, in FR. Innis
fed.), o. 37). The comespondence of the conceptimeaning ta the extemal form is mot in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable intemal relation but the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that “language does
not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from
within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences”. According to Saussure, "Meaning
is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntag matic
(e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g., synonyms) organized Into a signifying system” (Harker,
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities In selecting the signs within the

diqmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of ling uistic community
