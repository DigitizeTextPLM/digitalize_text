1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother te present itself as art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkbeimer and Acbarne, 2002, p. 05). This bueiness was based on what Adora referred to as Fordist
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniqnes: wel by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tomencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahi,
1995, p 142), Examples of thienot specified by Adornowere the Hollywood production syetem, or
the CBS radio network that bad been asociated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
2102, p. #9). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the ayeteam,
and that nothing trily adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkbeimer and Adorno, 2002, Pp.
LOG-7). Paradoxically, any innevation would only reaffirm the system, and Adorno cited Orean Welles
as an example of someqne who was allowed to break the roles, The éelusticity in the system would
allow it to asiume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineHerctwal
(Friedman, 1961, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
of sacial control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of economic
eoercion thmately meant the freedom to be the same {Horkheimer and Adorna, 2002, p. 136).

Since Adorno bad been, in his essays on music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, The
