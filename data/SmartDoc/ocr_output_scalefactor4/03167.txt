strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural at Sra

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society inta a systematic context, as opposed to
other writers in the Frankfurt School |\Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 60}. Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control me hanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
alfluence that kept elements of society satished and quiescent [Alway, 1905, p. 83). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were to
maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.

Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects

of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions
(Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However,
