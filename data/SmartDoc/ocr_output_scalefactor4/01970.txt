1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS
1 Weeds and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the setl-perceiyed needs of audience mem:
bers. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that ditferent people can use the same communication mes-
Sage for very diferent purposes. The same media content may gratify diferent needs for different
individuals. There is not only one way that people uses media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons
for using the media as there are media users [Blumer & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's. background, such as experience, interests, and
education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their
reeds. That ii, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratificatians
for using different media. McCuad, Blumer, and Brawn (1972) proposed a madel of “media-person
interachons” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or
proolems: emotional release: (2) Personal relationships: companion ip; social utility; (3) Personal

identity: ielf reference; reality exploration: value reindosces: and (4) Surveillance [forms of informa:
