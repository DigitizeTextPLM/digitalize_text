1 Needs and Gratifications

Lies and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audhence mem
bers, Blumber and Mate (1974) concluded that diferent people can use the same communicatean mes-
sape for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for diferent
individuals. There is not only one way that peaple uses media. Contrarily, there ane as many reasons
for using the media as there are modia users (Blumer & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such a5 experience, Interests, and
education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their
neds. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motwes and gratitications
jor using different media. Motuail, Blumer, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person
interactions” to cassey four important media gratitications: [1) Diversion: escape from routine or
problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationshigs: comnpaniorsheg; social ubllety: (3) Personal

identity: self reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and [4] Surveillance [forms ed inferrra-

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by MoGuire (1974), based
ona general theory of human needs, He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive ard
affective. Then he added three dirnensions: “active” versus “pasiive” initiation, “external” versus
“inbemal" goal orientation, and eenotion stability af “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
Uhede factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media ue [Figure 1). Figure 1.4
Sructuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (Moduire, 1974), Ratz, Gurevitch and Haas
