Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural linguistics.
To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation
by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systernatized set
of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which compose
it; as opposed to it, speach (parcle) is covers the purely individual part of Language" (Barthes, 1967,
p.18). Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimension, The structure level,
langue, is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized.
On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level, However,
it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact thal speech by an individual cannot be free from ihe
shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. Itig the social part of
language, itis essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if ome
wishes to communicate. It is because a language is 4 system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social insti-
tution, In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speach is essentially
an individual act of selecthon and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the lanquage with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual act and mot to a pure
creation, (Barthes, 1967, pe. 14-715)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system inbo two parts, the

signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the farm.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For examiple, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the extemal forms expressing the actual animal dog. Hare, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signifiad. “| propose to retain the word sign (signe) ta
designate the whole and te replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifia) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition thal sepa-
fates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis
fed.}, p. 37). The correspondence of ihe conceptimeaning to the external form is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation but the diflerence
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1950) argues that “language dows
not reflect a pre-existent and extemal reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from
within itself through a geries of conceptual and phonic differences". According to Saussure, “meaning
ig produced through & process of selection and combination ef signs along two axes, the syntagmatic
{é.9. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (€.g., synonyms), organized into. signifying system” (Barker,
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field ef possible signs that can
be replaced with one another, Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members, For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the follow-
ing sentence: “| went to a theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence is established throwgh the
linear combination of signs, The signs within the example, such as | theater, my, and girlfriend can be
substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as “She went to a restaurant with her mother."
Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated onky when
they are related to each other. “Crucially, signs do not make sense by virtue of reference to entities in
an independent object world; rather, they generate meaning by reference to each other, Thus, mean-
ing is understood as a social convention organized through ihe relations between signs” (Barker, ©.,
2002, p. 29). "Itis central to Saussures argument that red is meaningful in relation to the differance
between red, green, amber, etc. These signs are then organized into 6 sequence which generates
meaning through the cultural conventions of their usage within @ particular context
