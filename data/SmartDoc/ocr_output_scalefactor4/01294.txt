satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1544) mar bed them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s fl 1970s when television has grown
up. Seme basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era, Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is ome of the most well-known
and contributed greath to establishing the structure of the approach,

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher, He received his Ph.D. in So
clology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communicatian at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force ch arged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experien ce led to his subsequent aca demic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s tol990s (UPENN, 2001). In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its

experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Katz's mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lararsfeld, whois one of the pioneers of gratifications research,
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theary model. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
notion that people use the media to their benefit. Ina study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject

which is known as the uses and gratifications research were explored, They viewed the mass media as a means
by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to
their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published a collection of essay on pratifications in 1974 which
were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication. They took a more humanistic approach ta looking at media
use. They suggest that media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the user snd
they have alternate choices to satisfy their need. (Blumler & Katz, 1974), They also discovered that media

served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment a ical
! ' nd cultural transmis j
and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974). sseehitiall ean
