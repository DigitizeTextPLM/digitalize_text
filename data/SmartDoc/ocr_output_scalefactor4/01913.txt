i. GENESIS OF “THE CULTURE INDUSTRY”

1 Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry as well as its reception the concept can be
examined chronologically, from its pre-conditions, through its generation, to its subsequent impact. The idea of
the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, is developed through insights inte the mechanical re-
production of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only te popular music, but also te Hollywood
movies. That this i s0 grows out of a sumber of historical contingencies.

Adame was intradueed ta ‘Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin
never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorn
became in effect Benjamins only pupil. Atter Benjamin’s death “it was Adora who then intreduced a rational-
ized version of his ideas into academle philosophy.” (ager, 2004, p, 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had
an impact on the development of Adams thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adamo began
teaching at the Institute, Adomo lest his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Maza
party, Horkbeimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began
operating there. The Nazis rise to power net only meant that Adora lost his job and would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought, As Jingen Habermas would later note, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was ane of the historical expe-
riences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48).

Adorno was at Chord from 1994 to 1938, where he worked ono manuscript on Husserl, He was considered

an outsider, never imegrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked farvard to joining his Frank-
furt School colleaeues, many of wham had in the meantime moved to the United States. Alneady int the late
1930s Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during, the
1930s, Benjamin and Adome debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two mast popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “On the Fetish
Character in Susic and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adomo lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could
new be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adome was emphatic in his condemmatian af the mechanical reproduction of music. “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milteu
impossible” (Adorno, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction af aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adorno, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity, To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
wathericy of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea: to down of layers of imitations; to Adomo, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adomo. Im 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in éstablishing a relationship for the
Institute of Sockal Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in
New York, obtained a position for Aderne at the Princeton Radio Research Project. run by Paul Lacors-
feld, Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although he later claimed that he did mot know what a “rodio project™ wos. For bis part,
Lazarsteld looked forward to working with Adorno, whom be knew to be an expert on music. Adore
wrote for the Project's journal in 141, reiterating his position that radio was onky an image of a live perfor-
mance. In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio industry that the medium was bringing serious music
to the mastes (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 243) While working at the Princeton Radio Research Project Adomo
became shocked af the degre: ta which culture had become commercialized in the United States.

Adomno was Introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends, Since Benjamin

party. Horkbeimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Instituie began
