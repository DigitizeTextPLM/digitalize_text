1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty hat been identified as am important comstroct, necessary to the study of commu-
nication, it wold be beneficial i Know when the concept originated. and bene it has been defined
and studied. Gne way to consider uncertainry is through the theoretical framework of informacion
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed ina given situation when there
wai 4 high amount of possible allematives and the probability of their event was relatively equal
Shannan and Weaver related this view of uncertainry vo the transmission of messages, bat their work
ako conmiboted in the development of LRT. Berger and Calabrese (17975) adopoed concepes from the
information theorists as well as Heider (1958) research im atiribuiton. Berger and Calabrese (14975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty to [1 inlenpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as

dict behaviors and ocourences. Caring interacthons individuals are not only faced with problems of

process when they stated: “Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of altemarive things
that a siranper cam believe or potentially say" Uncertainty plays a significant role when examining
relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational developmem. Uncertainty can
cause stress dnd avery whieh con lead to low levels of communicator competence (West & Turner,
2000). Incomperen communicaiors may not be able co develop relationships or may be oo anions
to engage in initial interactions. Weer and Tomer (2000) moor that lower levels of ancertaingy caused
increased verbal and nonverbal behavior, increased levels of intimacy, amd increased Liking. In inter-
actions individuals ane exqpected to increase predictability with che goal that this will lewd to the ability

diffioalt to reach this gaa. Alihough individual seek to reduce uncertainty, high levels of certainty
and predictabilicy can also inhibit a relationship. Pbeath and Bryant (21000) stase: “Too much certainty
and predictability can deaden a relacionship;
