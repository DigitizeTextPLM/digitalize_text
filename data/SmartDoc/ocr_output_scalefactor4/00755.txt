itis well accepted that communication theares have developed through the realms of psychology and so-
ciology aver the past 100 years. With illumed by valuable ideas as well as exploring mare untilled fields in these
two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding media. Asa sub-tradition of
media effects research, uses and gratifications approach is sugmested to be originally stemmed from a func:
tionalist paradigm in the social sclences [Blumler & Katz, 1974]. To dome extent, however, functional theany
On COMMUnication agrees with media's effects towards people. For example, & model often used iin the the-
ory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential
effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ infarmatian into the consciousness of the masses” [Watson & Hill 1297, p.
105), Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1940s. After that, a shift
which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses
ane gratifications approach.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people ta be attracted to certain media is almost as old as
empirical mass cormmunication research itself (McCluail, 1983). Dating back te the 1940s, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such as soap operas and quizzes, a5 well
as daily mewspaper {Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Merzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1946; ete.). In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium
itself (Katz et al, 1974), For instance, radia soap operas were found to satisly thelr listeners with advice,
support, or occasions for ermational release (Herzog, 1944: Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering

. information, newspaper was alo discovered ta be important te give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure to the daily routine [Berebon, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of uiage
satisfaction, paychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Lises and pratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic aisumptions of the approach were proposed when it wad rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars whe focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known

: ; and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.
| a Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and a5 a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in Soe
\ala : : - dolagy in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicaga until 1963, Guring
—aa the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
att sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government of israel, Katz headed the task force changed
with the introduction of television broadéasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s tol 9oos (UPENM, 2001). In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and alee directed its
experimental scholars program for post-doctoral study,

Kate's mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsfold, whois one of the pioneers of gratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theory model. Later, Katz intraduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
nation that people use the media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject
which is known as the uses and gratifications research were explored. They viewed the mass media as a means
by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to
their needs more readily than the media overpower them Katz, Gurevitch amd Haas, 1973),

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 which
were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication. They took a more humanistic approach te looking at media
use. They suigpest that media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the user and
they have alternate choices to saticty thelr need. (Blumler & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that media
served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission for both society
and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974),
