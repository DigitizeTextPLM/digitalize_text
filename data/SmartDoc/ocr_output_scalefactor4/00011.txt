Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting te
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presesita public Telations ag a tool that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The ohjective-minded public relations

1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public le softer than that of Lippmann, a& he recognizes the power of
eqoiey, kak still also Claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1052) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citlzens in general, public relations i important because it helps them

the public is still peesible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public epinion. Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ella tended ta disagree with this point.
