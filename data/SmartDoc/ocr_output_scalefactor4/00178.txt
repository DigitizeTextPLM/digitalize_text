Uses and Gratifications

1.1 Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media research origina
conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the aL share
certain media contents, The core question of such research is: Why do people usé media
and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1983), There exists a bast: idea in this approach:
qudience members know media content, and which media they can Use to meet their needs.
In the mass communication process, USes and gratifications approach puts the function of
linking need gratificatians and media choice clearly on the side of audiance members. It
suggests that peaple’s n hey would choose, how they use cer-

tain media and what gratificatio
theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users as opposed to
passive receivers af information, In contrast to traditional media effects theories which focus
on “what media do to people” and assume audiences are homogeneous, Uses and gratifica-
tions approach is more cancerned with “what peaple do with media’ (Katz, 1959). It allows
audiences persanal neads to use media and responds to the media, which determined by
their social and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates
that the media compete with other information sources for audience's need satisfaction (Kalz
et al, 1974). AS traditional mass media and new media continue to provide people with a
wide range af media platlonns and content, it is considered one of the most appropriate
perspectives for investigating why audiancas choose to be exposed to diferent.
The approach emphasizes audiences’ choice by assessing their reasons for using
a certain media to the disregard ofothers, as wellas the various gratifieations obtained
from the media, hased on individual social and ogical P
