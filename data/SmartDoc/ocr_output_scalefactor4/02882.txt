This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1954) 2 :

stated, “Who says what in which channel to wham and with what effects” {p. 24), Content analysis was esen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to-do a lot of work within this area during the
remainder of his career,

Aside from understanding the contentof prapaganda, Lasswell was alto interested in how propaganda coubd
shape public opinion, This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell bas created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented ta them,
and also apprehensive to accept it, However, it is still that information that is affecting thelr decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmarmn’s theories,

12 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (161-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public apinian. Bernays (1928)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events ta influence the relations of a
public to an enterprise, ides, of group (p. 25). Contrary ba oiler propaganda theorists, Hemays Hey we
