Uncertainty Reduction

L1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twenticih century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the develogment of communication theary. Information exchange is a basic human function in
whieh Individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainhy, Dncer-
tointy Reduction theory (URT), accredited ta Charles R. Berger and Richard J, Calabreae (1973), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development of UIRT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of Information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 153). The study of information is basic
to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the role of communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the fleld of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories a5 starting pointe” (p. 9)
The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporanes marked the emergence of inter-
personal communication research, with the development of URT. communication researchers began te look to
communication for thearies of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social
sciences.
