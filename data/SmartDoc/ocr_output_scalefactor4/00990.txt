1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the i

culture industry outside of a German context. In the years aides there iy er hiles
SUS Criticisms of the text, not least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about ‘the
commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adomo erred in not discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, be-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton,
1991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
among oppressed peoples in saciety has some pari to play in the reproduction of the sys-
tem a8 a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adonna’s idea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the 1960s
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1540s.
While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial soci-
eties between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl,
7995, p. 146-48), Thus, for a some critics, the en pie ei a the poe ae would

Thue for same critics modernist works would be counteracting forces against the dominant
ideology. As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case that the
dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of the culture
industry has had an importance in critical theory since its appearance in the 1940s, in that
it has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation to ideology, au
hence, society. Since Adomo made sweeping generalizations about the impact setae =
