SES: the geal of understanding the "stream of influence that rans fram control to content and from concent
to audience” (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definitics af communication whieh
sated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" (p. Bl), Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to de a lot af wark within this area during the
remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how peopaganda could
ghape public opinion. This dealt primarily with urelerstanding the effects of the media, Latswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. [In ehis
Way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive bo accept it, Flowever, it is gull that information that is affecting thelr decisions within
the democratic system, anel is being presented ta them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s thearles.
