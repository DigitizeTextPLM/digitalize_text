1. Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examinatice of uncerlainty in communication.
The influence of their woek can be seen reflected in the assumptices of Berger and Calabrese (1974),

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1999)

Leon Festinger studied peychology al the University of lowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,
one mf the founders of social paychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a sub-
stangial influcnor on the development of interpersonal communication. After gradwation, initially
worked af the University of Rochester, but in 194% he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Terati-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics, Afier Lewin dear, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the Mew School for Social Research
(Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger’s research follewed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Leain’s theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging field at in-
fenpersonal commvanication and on the developencne of URT. Festinger 1 best known for ihe theores
of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted to
explain how an imbalance ameng cognitions might affect an individual, Lewin foreshadowed cor |
in his observations regarding antibode change in small groups (Festinger, (982). COT alkras for three |
relationships to occur ameng cognitions: & consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equi-
librium with cach other, a dissonant relationshap, in which cognitoes arg in eitipeliteon with each Sy
other: and an irrelevant relationshig., i which the ceypaitions in gagstion have no effect on one anther | _
(West & Tumer, 2000), Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an clement of arousal and dirs-
camifoet that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory pospalabes that inedividhuals book to
feedback from others to evaluate cheir performance and abilitess. To evalgate the self, the individual
usually seeks che opinions of others whe are similar 10 the self, This need for social comparison can
result im ganformily pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, 2M) Berger and Calabrese (1973) related s0-
