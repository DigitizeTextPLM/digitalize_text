of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on oocasion attempt es Pi

in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk i Germany in 1963 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film,
Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to
the culture industry, within the context of modernist (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 131).

9 Qne-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Mareuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed ta
other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p- 609), Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 14d). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose maim objectives were ta
maintain social control and continue ta perpetuate the ideology that maintained that contral.
Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions
(Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, it is difficult in Marcuses argument to separate culture
or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass
Media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno
had done. In the end Marcuses analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant
ideology. Marcuse wrote, "how can the administered individualswho have made their mutilation
into their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged scaleliberate
themselves from themselves as well as from their masters? How is it even thinkable that th
vicious circle be broken? (Marcuse, 1991, p, 251). Given the pessimistic tone of the aes
