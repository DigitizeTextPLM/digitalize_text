2 aheeee has become the standard texthook on diffusion theary and iLeneats applications of diffu-
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously
mentioned, communication, Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was
suffering from kidney disease. He died on Cctober 21, 2005.
_ According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu-
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
15 an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
sion of innovations invelves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 404).
That is, by sharing communication channels such a8 interpersonal communication or mass commu-
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, 5-M-C-R-E
(e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect), Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this $-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a mew idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) recetvers can be members of a social system, and finally
(4) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theary, ‘Time’ variable
is a ¥ery important factor, According to Rogers (1993), time variable is invelved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness: (3) an innovation's rate of adoption, Most inmo-
vations have an S-shaped nvte of adoption. Diffiesion msearch hav attempted to explain the variables
thet influence how and why users and audience adapta new information medium, such az the Internet.
deconding to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even though in the
past the individual is usually the unit af analysts, Also, critical sass becomes ar fmaportant factor tr

theory not only can apply te practical things, but also car be related to digital divide,

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innewativencss:
#1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditionaly” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-1 #5). Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure 1 shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innovativenecss and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these calegories
follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped. Source by www2.gsu.eduwwwitr/docs/dif-
fusion’ Figure 2 shows that an innovation would spread through society over various periods of time im
a S-shaped curve. However, as noted above, different types of innovations (e.g., the rate of tetracycline
adoption is faster than that of the hybrid seed com) can have their own different rates in diffusion. Fig-

there are five stages.

lL. Knowledge + or = (selective exposure or awareness of news)

Attitudes + or — (people have positive or negative attitude toward innovations)

3, Adoption (Decision): people decide to adopt the innovation
4, Implementation {regular or standard practice)

_ Confirmation {comparing and evaluating)
