i, GENESS OF "THE CULTURE INDUSTRY"

1 Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry as well as its reception the concep? can be
examined chronaogically, from its pre-conditions, through its generation, to its subsequent impact, The idea of
the culture industry grows out of a concer with culture, is developed through Insights inte the mechanical re-
production af culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition nat only te papular music, but alo te Hally wood
movies. That this isso grows out of a number of histarical cantingencies.

Adomo was intraduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends, Since Benjamin
never received a degree that would allow hit ta teach al a university, according ta Hannah Arendt, Adore
became in effect Benjamins only pupil. After Benjamin's death “it was Adomo who then introduced a rational:
ized version of his ideas into academic philosophy." (Jager, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had
an impact on the development of Adornos thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began
teaching at the Institute, Adorno oat his right to teach in September 1933 due ta the rise to power of the Mazi
party. Horkheineer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switrerland, and the Institute began
operating there. The Nazis rise to pawer not only meant that Adorno Lost his job ond would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jirgen Habermas would later nate, the
fact that labor mowensenis were co-opted in the development of feaciat regimes was one of the historical expe-
riences influencing the development of critical theary, the others heing Stalinist repression amd the production
of mass culture inthe United States (Morris, 2001, p, 48),

Adora was at Oxtond fram 1944 to 1998, where be worked on a manuscript on Husserl, He wos considered
an outsider, newer integrating into the British academic mainstream, ard be looked forward to joining his Frank-
furt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved te the United States. Already lin the late
19305 Adomo evidenced litte haope for mass culture. As propoganda and entertainment increased during the
19305, Benjamin and Adomo debated mass culture, since film amd radio became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “(On the Petish
Character in Mushe and the Repression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Wark of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkborst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary prablem for Adomo Jay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in-a concert hall, symphonic works could
now be beard aver the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferor ta the
original, and Adomo was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Ademo, 2001b, p. 47), While Benjamin regarded the destraction of aura by protograph or film
6 the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied bo class, to Adama, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge azairet the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Ideas to down of layers of imitations; to Adame, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adamo, In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who bad succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in
New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, run by Paul Luzars-
feld, Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although he later claimed that be did not know pra a) cede eek aa Bas BESET
