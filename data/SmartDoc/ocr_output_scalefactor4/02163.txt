1 Defining Uncertainty

Sance ancerainty hes been identified as am inapertant construct, necessary to che study ef commu-
nication, it wok! be beneficial io know when the concep! cciginated, and how it has been defieed
and studied. One way ie consider uncertainty is through che theoretical framewark af information
theary. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed chat uncertainty existed ina given situation when chere
wai a high amount of possible aliematwes and the probability od their event was relatively equal.
Shannon ac] Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the cransmission of messages, but their work,
48o contributed to the development of VET. Berger and (Caladrese (1975) adopted concepts from the
information theorists 6 well as Heider (1958) research in amriberion. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept af umcemainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as
ihe “number of altennative ways in whoch each interactant might behave” (p. LO). The greater the
Jevel of uncemainry that exists ma situation, the smaller the chance individoals will be able bo pre-
dict behaviors and occurrences. During interactions individuals are not only faced with problems of
predicting present amd past behaviors. but ale explaining why partners behave or beloeve in the way
that they do. Berger amd Aradac's (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this
process when they stated: “Lincertainty, then, can stem from the lange number of atemative things
that a stranger cam believe or potentially say Uncertainty plays a significant pole wher examining,
relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational developmem, Lecenainty can
couse stress and anxiety which con lead fo bow levels of communicdior compenence (West & Tamer,
7000). Incompetent communicators may nat be able to develop relatioeships or may be too anxious
to engage in initial interactions. West and Turner (20000) note that lower levels of ancertainty caused
increased verbal and noorverbal behavior, increased Jewels of intimacy, and increased liking. In imer-
actions individuals are expected to increase predictability with the goal that this will lead to the ability
to predict and explain what will occur in future interactions. When high unceriaimty exists at is aften
difficult to reach this goal. Although individuals seek to reduce uncestainey, high levels of certainty
and predictability can also inhibit a relationship, Heath and Biryant (2000) state; “Too much cestainty

and predictability can deaden a relasionship,
