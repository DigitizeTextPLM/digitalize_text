Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 19505 till 1970s when television has grown

Up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscowernd during that era. 4
the group of scholars whe focus on uses and pratfications research, Elihu Katz is one of se Cerna
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher, He recelwed fis PROD. in Sa.
ciology in 1356 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1953. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Cammunication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
wath the introduction of television broadcasting. Thit experience Ind to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s to1590s (UPEMN, 2001). in
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Penndylvania, and also directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Kate's mentor in Galumbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, who ls one of the pooneers of gratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that conmect the concept of gratification: with the

functional theory model, Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
notion that people use the media to their benefit. Ina study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject
which is known as the uses and gratifications research were explored. They viewed the mais media as a means
by whieh individuals connect or disconnect themselves with athers and found that people bend the media to
their needs more readily than the media overpower thern (Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumier, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 which
ware entitled The User of Mass Communication. They teak 4 more humanistic aparoach te looking at meadia
use, They sugpest that media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the user and
they have alternate cholces to satisfy their need. (Blumer & kate, 1974]. They alsa discovered that media
served the funetions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission for bath society

and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1374).
