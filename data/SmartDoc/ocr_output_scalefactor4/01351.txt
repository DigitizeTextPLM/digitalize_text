1 Other Propaganda Theorists

1.1 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Laswell was undertaking empirical pape et ii
fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being wrth

Seine (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of prapagarsha research. - fost on
conducting both quantitative ard qualitative analyses of prapaganda, understanding the peated Pr ie a
anddiscuvering the effect of prapaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Laswell is cre chen eae
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content sere wer s
defined as, "the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content eg
in arder ta measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled "Contents af Communication,
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which o ee
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience’s apinion,

the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content af the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence chat runs from eaatrel ta content and from content
1o audience (p. 74) :

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1959) early definition of communication which
stated, "Wie says what in which channel te whom and with what effects" (p. 64). Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part ef this definition, and Lasswell weot on to do a lot of work within this area curing, the
remainder of his cancer,

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effeccs of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presenced co chem by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories.

1.2 Edward Bernays (1991-1995)

Al approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1491-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays (1928)
defines propaganda 5, 4 consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events te influence the relations of a
public to an enterprise, idea, or group (p, 25), Contrary ta other propaganda theorists, Bermays recognizes
that propaganda can be either beneticial or harmful to the public. Et can help individuals decide what w think
about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may sctually be beneficial to society's functioning asa whale,
Bemays Hates, “We are governed, our minds are molded, aur tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely ky
men we have never heard of... Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live
together as a smacthhy fonctioning society (p. 4),

Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be modified, and that such shaping i : r
society, Bemays pursued his work in the field of public relations, “Public relations ic zt =Car id an
persuasion, and adjustment, to engineer public support for an activiry, cause, movement, or institution" (Bemays,
1955, p. 3). fn the Engineering of Consent, Bermays (2955) lays aut the framework for understanding the 7,
and developing a public relations campaign. Bernays (1955) claims that the key to a successfull public REG a :
