1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of commu
nication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined
and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed ina given situation when there
Was a high amount of possible alternatives ancl the probability of their event was relathvely equal
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
also contributed to the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the
information theorists as well as Heider (1958) research in attribution, Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as
the “number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 100). The greater the
level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to pre-
dict behaviors and occurrences. During interactions individuals are not only faced with problems of
predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way
that they do. Berger and Bradac’s (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this
process when they stated: “Uncertainty, inet, can stem fram the large canes of ONE oe
that a stranger can believe or potentially say” Uncertainty plays 4 signiticant role nr ee Se
relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational silat sonia Eee can

«. West and Turner (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty ae
eased levels of intimacy, and increased liking. In inter-

individuals are expected to increase predictability with the goal that this will lead to the pent
