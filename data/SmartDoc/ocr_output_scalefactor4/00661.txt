1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion,
social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the robe of learning, dissonance, hal-
ance, social judgment, and reactance (Berges, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather af social psychology,
played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider,
Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm af sacial inleraction,
relational development and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars
a5 Knapp, Mehratian, Aleman, Tayloe, Duck, Kelley, acl Thihaut During the later part of the decade
and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Rolott, and Berger became popular
along with research mio behavioral amd communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoan, and Patterson.
Berger (2005) stares: “these early theoretical forays helped shape che interpersonal comm research
agenda during the past qwo decades” [p, 416), Today, interpersonal commundcation tends to focus
on dyadic communication, communication invalving face-to-face interaction, ar communication as
a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theary typically
fomuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolucion of relationships. It has been recognized
that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975)
Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study thar has.
contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus
on those theoriets who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work

is crucial te the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central im our
understanding of interpersonal processes,
