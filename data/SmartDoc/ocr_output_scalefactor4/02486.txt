on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interachon, or cOMMMUTCcanon as
a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically
focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized
that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).
Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major fleld of study that has
contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus
on those theorists who pianeered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work
is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our
understanding of interpersonal processes,

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified a3 an important construct, necessary to the study of commu-
nication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined
and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory, Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a piven situation when there
was a high amount of possible altematives and the probability of their event was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
also contributed t¢ the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the
information theorists as well as Heider (1958) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as
the “number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" {p. 100). The greater the
level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance Individuals will be able to pre-
dict behaviors and occurrences. During interactions individuals are not only faced with problems of
predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way
that they do. Berger and Bradac’s (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this
process when they stated: “Unoertaincy, then, can stem from the large number of alternative thing

that a stranger can believe or potentially say" Uncertainty plays a significant role when exami ee
Telatlonships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development. Uncertainty can
cause stress and anxiety which ean lead to low levels of communicator competence (West & Turner
2000), Incompetent communicators may net be able to develop relationships or may Bes aires
