I. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in
Europe. Further, the prevalence of adverticing in the United States was something with no correlative
in Europe. The closest thing in Adornos experience te the advertising industry in the United State
was feeclet propaganda (Jhper, 2004, p. 122). Adomo was later ta allude to his experience with
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the casa on the culture industry by noting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda [Horkheimer and Adore, 2002, p. 97]. [tb became obviauws that Lazarsield and Adorno did
not agrees an the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adotnos dissatisfaction with
the werk of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop
the idea of the culture incdustry.

Because of the relationship between the freshitute for Social Reacarch and Cofturibea University,
Hortkeimer, wha Aad already moved to Califernia, cond not bring Adorno fo the Wrest Cogat undil

included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hons Bisler, Thames and Meinrich Monn, Alfred Dabin, end
Bertolt Brecht, seceral of which food work in the Hollavood monte industry. The fact that Adorno

These preconditionsAdornes Interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the
relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important te an understanding of
his ceaeern for the idea of the culture industry,

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adomo, popular culture an flen wand radia did nat bother to present iteelf as art. They were inetead
4 business, and this in tarn berame an ideology te Iegitimize the trash they intentionally peoduce
(Horkhelmer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitilign, in which mass production based on the techniques weed by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, imsofar we these tendencies were baged an centralization and hierarchy ([Hohendahl,
1985. p. 142). Examples of thisnat specifed by Adomoawere the Hollywood prodwction system, or
the CHS media network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
B02, p. 980. Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adomo, 2002, p.
1Mi-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, and Aderoo cited Orson Welles
ac an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would
allow if to assume the stance of any opposition and make it ite own, wltimately rendering it inefectual
(Friedman, 1981, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
of social control (Horkheuner and Adora, 3002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of economic
epercion ultimately meant the freedom to be the came [Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 136).

Since Adorno had been, in his essays on music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, The
Culture Industry has been criticized as being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture.
Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and
Adorno, 2002, p. 101). Tt was not high art that Adorno was presenting as an alternative to the culture
industry, but modernism. Although he provides the idea of an opposing force to the culture industry,
Adorno provides no overt Marxist analysis. Instead, be motes in passing that the dominant system
utilized capacitios for mass consumption for entertainment or amusement,
