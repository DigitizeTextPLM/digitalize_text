were published without their permission in 1949, Horkheimer and Adorno protested, bedi
themselves from their own work, in order not ta jeopardize their return to Germany. ve
1940s the Institute relocated ta Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises 10 1951. Horkheimer
hecame the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954 Adorno published an essay
entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of a study that had been done for the
Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner and others. In this essay Adorno
warned, rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed
of psychological control (Adorno, 2001a, p. 160). It was one of the few occasions im the 1950s
that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments
of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape
his thought on the culture industry, For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal psewdo-culture
in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film,
Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 131).

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to
other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social contrel mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent [Alway, 1995, p. 83). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideclogy whose main objectives were to
taintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.
Echoing Adorne, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects

of mass media could be differentiated from their Thanipulation and indoctrination functions

(Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, it is difficult in Marcuses argument tO separate culture

OF mass media from society asa whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or

media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that dices

had done. In the end Marcuses analysis of soci iti

ety allowed for no opposition ta th i
ideclogy, Marcuse wrote, "how can the administered individualswho have made be ee
into their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged janes
themselves from themselves as well as from their masters? How is it even thinkable that th
vicious circle be broken? (Mareuse, 1991, p. 251). Given the i
