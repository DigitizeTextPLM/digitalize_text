and studied. Cae way to consider wmcertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed thal uncertainty existed ina given siruateon whim thene
was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their erent was relalively equal
Shanon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but iheir work
also coneribarted to the development of UT. Berger and Calaocese (1975) adopted concepts trom the
