1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience mem-
bers, Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication mes-
sage for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different

individuals. There is not only one way that people uses media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons
for using the media as there are media users [Blumler & Katz, 19774).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and
education, affect people's ideas about what they want fram m

edia and which media best meet their
needs. That is, audiente members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications

for using diferent media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-person
interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine oF
problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal

identity: self reference; reality exploration; value reinforces, and (4) Surveillance {forms of informa-
tion seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by MeGuire (1974), based
on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective, Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus
“internal” goal orientation, and emotion stability af “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use {Figure ij, Figure 2. 4
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation [MoGuire, 1974). Katz, Gureviteh and Waas

(1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
put them inte five categories;

1, Cognitive needs, including acquiring infonmation, knowledge and understanding;

+, Affective needs, including emation, pleasure, feelings:
3. Personal integrative needs, inetuding credibility, stability status,
4, Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends; avd
5 Tension release needs, including #scape and diversion.
