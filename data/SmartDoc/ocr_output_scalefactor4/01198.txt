ritical Response to “The Culture Industry”
The 197 ish-
nthe dae language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the

ie sectors, including Marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996. p. 48).

or Terry Eagleton, both Adorne and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, be-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification’ ate
1991, p. 46). Stil, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
amend oppressed peoples in society has some part to Play in the reproduction of the sys-
tem as a whole (Eagleton, 1991. p. 36). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adorno's idea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the 1960s
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1940s
While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial soci-
eties between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl
1995, p. 146-48). Thus, fora some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry would
appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value at all.

Thus for some critics modernist works would be counteracting forces against the dominant
ideology. As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case that the
dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of the culture
industry has had an importance in critical theory since its appearance in the 1940s, in that
it has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation to ideology, and
hence, society. Since Adomo made sweeping generalizations about the impact of the culture
industry, and since he did not systematically explore how the culture industry operated, ithas
been generally easy for some to dismiss the idea of a culture industry. It is nonetheless the
case that motion pictures are still made by large companies and that their movies largely rely
on formulaic plots. It is also the case that radio is increasingly controlled by a small number
of companies, which tend to impose restrictions on how stations operate. tits ae
medium, television is very much related to both radio and film, and shares ea ; he ee dace
that situation it in the culture industry. While there is a democratizing aspect to tne Inter
te a web site), it happens that the commercial companies operating
a at Sain to maintain an ideological function. For example, one seldom sees
ee bei tee ie MSNBC or Yahoo that would question the prerogatives of corporate America,

ri

pee aration of the idea of the culture industry may be necessary in order to theorize on

how mass communication media pro pagate dominant ideologies.
