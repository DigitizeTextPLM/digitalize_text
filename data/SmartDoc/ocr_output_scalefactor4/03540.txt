1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

i died psychology atthe University of lowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,
ge tieh t apa ata and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had sub-
stantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
(Samelson, 2000), Much of Festinger’s research followed his nventor Lewin and further developed
Lewin’s theories, Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging field of in-
terpersonal communication and on the development of URT, Festinger is best known for the theories
of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted to
explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed CDT
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982), CDT allows for three
relationships to occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equi-
librium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each
other; and an ierelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another
(Weat & Ture, 2000), Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an clement of arousal and dis-
comfort that individuals seek to reduce, Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to
feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual
usually secks the opinions of others whe are similar to the self. This need for social comparison can
result in conformity pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, 2004). Berger and Calabrese (1973) related so-
cial comparison to URT by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons seek owt similar others
who are proximate when they expericnes a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of
their behavior and’or opinions in a particular situation” (p. LOT). Festinger received the Distinguished
Scientist award of the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Senior Scientist
Award from the Sockeby of Experimental Social Psycholouy. Festinger's legacy is significant, and
his theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research. Aronson (in
Festinger, 1980) Stated, “Tt wae in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of
Cognitive dissonance, amd in my opinion, social psychology has not been the same since” (p. 3). "

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider eared his doctorate it philosophy trom the University of Graz. ma Oe PEE

Eyrope, Heider worted with sony renowned psychologists such as Ho ifvan aia Seth fbi
and Kurt Lewin. Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin as a substantial impact on his life: “I want
to pay tribute to Lewin atimuluting influence, which has affected much of my thinking and which |

still strong even in this book, although it does not derive directly from his work" (Heider oe &
vil). [In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later the LI i pinay P.
Kansas where he worked for the remainder of his life (Ash, 2000), T the University of
