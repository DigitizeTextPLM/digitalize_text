ia “s, Fesearchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium
itself (Katz et al., 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice,

information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared ta

of conversation and a structure ta the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of USape
satisfaction, psychologist He riog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
Up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greathy to establishing the structure of the approach

Elihu Katz is served bath as a sociologist and as a cormmunication researcher. He received his Ph.O. in So
ciology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty Wears, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Garnmunication at the Hebrew Umiver-
sity of Jerusalem, In the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged

broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s tel290s (UPE Al, 2001) Ht
