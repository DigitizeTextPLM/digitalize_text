Ala nguage is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values, It is the social part of
lan Guage, itis essentially a collective contract which ame must accept in its entiraty if one
wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming fram a single individual and is consea uently a social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization, The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is

essentially a combinative activity that it conespands to and individual act and notte a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic lavel, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the
signified and the signifier, The signified is a concept or meaning which 16 expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog, Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa:
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959, inR Innis
(ad.), p. 37). The correspondence of the conce pumeaning to thie external form is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. lt is mot the mevitable interme! relation but the poate
