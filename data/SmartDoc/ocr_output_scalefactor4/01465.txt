Rogers was born in Carroll, lowa in 1931. He earned his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D, degrees from lowa
State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Atr Force. Interestingly,
in 1966, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea.

The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creats applications of diffu-
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously
mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was
suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005

According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an inn ovation is commu-
nicated through certain channels over time BITLO the members of a social SVS(eM. An Innovation
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 414).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu-
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, 5-M-C-R-E
(¢.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-cffect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this $-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variable
is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables
that influence how and why users and audience adopt a new information medium, such as the internet,
According to evolution of media technology, Interpersonal influences are Important even though in the
past the individual is usually the unit of analysis. Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in

adopting mew media hecause new media are interactive tools and thus are required by many users to

gain efficiency. That is, the more peaple use, the mare people get benefits. In this sense, diffusion
fheary not only can apply to practical things, but also can be related to digital divide.

[here are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
“/1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting mew ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure | shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories
follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped. Source by www2.gsu.eduwwwwitr/docs/dif-
fusion! Figure 2 shows that an innovation would spread through society over various periods of time in
a S-shaped curve, However, as noted above, different types of innovations (¢.g., the rate of tetracycline
adoption is faster than that of the hybrid seed com) can have their own different rates in diffusion. Fig-

there are five stages.
