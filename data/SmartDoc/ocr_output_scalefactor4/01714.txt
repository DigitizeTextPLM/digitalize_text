a eared with media's effects towards people. For example, a model often used in the the-
ory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential
effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information into the consciousness of the masses” (Watson & Hill 1997, p
a Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 19405, After that, a shift
which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses
and gratifications approach.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as
empirical mats communication research itself (McQuail, 1983]. Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such as soap operas and quizzes, as welll
as daily newspaper (Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; ete.) In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium
itself [Katz et al, 19746). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice,
Support, oF occasions for emotional release [Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948): rather than just offering

information, newspaper was alec discovered to be important to give readers a pense af security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelsan, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog [1944] marked them with the term “gratifications”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1330: 19706 when television has prawn
