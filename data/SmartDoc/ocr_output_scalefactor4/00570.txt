1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty bas been Rlentified a5 am impoctant construct, necessary to the study af comini-
nécation, i would be beneficial oo know when the concep! originated, amd how it has been defined
and studied. (ne way te consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1515) proposed that uncertainty existed ina given sinsation when there
wed a high amount of possitle altematves and the probability of their event was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
also contributed te che development of WET. Berger and Calabrese { 1075) adepied concepts from the
informalsan theorists as well as Heider (1958) research in attrition. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainry te fit interpersimal communicabos hy defining uncerainty a3
the “wamber of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 104). The greater the
level of uercertainty that exists im a sieuaiton, the smaller the chance indiwidaals will be able Io pre-
eet behaviors and occurrences. Casting, interactions individuals are nit only faced with prodlems of
predicting present and past behaviors, burt alse explaining why partners beherve or believe in the way
that they do. Berger and Brecac’s (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this
pocess when they stared: “Lincertainty, then, cam ste from. the large number of aliernatrve things
