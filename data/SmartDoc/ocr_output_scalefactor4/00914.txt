Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation far communication
research and the development of communication theary, Informatioe exchange is a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty, Emcer-
tofety Reduction theory (URT), accredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncerainty
research. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “Ome of the motivations underpinning interpersanal communication
ig the acquisition of information with which ta reduce uncertainty” (p, 143). The study of information is basic
to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study af uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. LIRT places the role of communication into the central

focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication, Berger and Cal-

abrese (1975) nate: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the astral

communication process, they have tended to employ sockal psychological theories a skis points” {P. nF).

The research underlying the theary and efforts made by other cantemporartes marked the emergence of inter-

personal communication research; with ihe development of URT, cotmunication ee began pen

communication for thearies of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in ather soci

sciences.
