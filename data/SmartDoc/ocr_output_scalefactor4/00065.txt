for using different media. McChuail, Blurmler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media-perso

interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: [1} Diversion; escape from reutine or

problenis; emotional release; (2) Personal relations
identity: self reference; reality exploration; value re

tion seeking).
Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by MeGuire (1974), based

ona general theary of human needs, He distinguished between two types of needs: meEnitive and
affective, Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus

self-percelved needs of audience mem

hips: companionship; secial utility; (2) Personal
inforces; and (4) Surveillance (forms of informa-

“internal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,

these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (MoGuire, L974). Katz, Gurevitch and Haas
(1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding;

7, Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;

3. Persona! integrative needs, including credibility, stability, status,

4. Social integrative needs, including interacting with family ond friends; and

5, Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.
