1, CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing
public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22], Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase,
the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning, And it is careful planning more
than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity and
propaganda (Bernays, 15, p.22). Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent a different wew of
the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66), Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea
that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terme the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, ite aims, ite objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing te accept {p. 6).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bertays presents public relations as a tool that can be
ised to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations
man helps his client adjuet to the contemporary eituation, ar helps the public adjust to it (Bearnays,
1952, p. 9), Bernays view of the public ia softer than that af Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
society, tht still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
henehts of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is lmportant because it helps them
to understand the sociery of which we are all a part, bo know and waluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate ciforts being made boy others,
and to persuade or suggest courses of action [p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of

the public is atill possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance af the public opinion. Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with thie point,

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Dosswell, Ell, ond Bernays are important for a number of
reasons. Based on the ideos of kis predecessors, Lippmonn was able fo bring offention te the fact dat

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily to bath the direct etfects and limited effects

propaganda could directly influrnce the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, theoriate uct a Lippmann
