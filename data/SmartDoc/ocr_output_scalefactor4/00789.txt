- As Lippmann wies writing propaganda, Harold Lasewell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In
fact, much of the propaganda than Lasswell was examining was actually being writen by Lippmann himself
(Rogers, 1944).

Haold Lasswell (15902-1978) was a peominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on
conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the connene of propaganda,
and discovering the elect of propaganda ce the mass audience (Rogers, 1944), Lasswell credited with cresting,
the mass commenication peocedure of coment analysis (Rogers, 1994), Generally, content analysis cam be
defined as," ..che invedigation of communication messapes by calgorizing message coment into classifications
inorder to measure certain variables” (Hogers, 1944) In an essay entailed “Combencs of Communication,”
Lasewell (1416) explains that a content analysis shoukl take into account dhe frequency wah which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the immensity af the symbols used, By undentanding the conmar of the message, Lasswell (1546) aime te

This method of content analysis. is tied strongly so Laswell (1/553) early definition of communication which
stated, “Wino says what in which channel io whom and with what effeces" (pA). Comer analyses was essen-

Aside from ondersunding the coment of peopagatala, Lacswell was also ineresped in how propaganda could
shape publicopinion. This dead: peimarily with understanding the effects of the media. Laswell was particularly

AU appecoimately the same Gime that Lippmans aad Lanswell were examoning public opinion and propa garda,
Edwaed Bemays (1091-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Erersarys (1528)
defines peopaganda a5, a consisnest, enduring efor Ww create or shape evenis bo itfhetice the eelaceons of a
public to an enierprise, ieira, or geoup (jp. 25) Contrary in other propagaieia theorist, Bermays mooognines
that propaganda cam be either beneficial or harmful to the public. can belp individuals decide what to think
about or alber the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to society's functioning as a whole

Bermays siaes, “We are gowermed. our mindy are melded, our tastes formed, cur ideas sugpesed. largely by
