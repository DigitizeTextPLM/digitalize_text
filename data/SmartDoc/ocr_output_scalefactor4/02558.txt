defined as, "che investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content inte classi atbons
in order to measure certain variables" (Ropers, 1994). In an essay entitled “Contents of Comnmnnicaxicn,
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into accaunl the frequency with which ane
symbols appear in a messape, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, an
the intensity of the symbals used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence that runs from centrol to content and from content
to aodience” tp. 74). i

This method of content analysis is tied strongly te Lasswell (1953) early definiton of communication which
stated, "Whe says what in which channel to whom and with what effects” (p. 64), Content analysis was essen-
dally the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a bot of work within this area during the
remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was alse interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion, This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. [n this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accepe it. However, it is still that information that is affecting their decisions within
ihe demveratic syitem, and is being presenced co chem by the government, This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann's theorles.

L2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

Ad approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1691-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays (1926)
defines propaganda 53, 2 consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of a
public to an enterprise, idea, or group (p. 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorist, Bemays recognines
that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public. [t can help individuals decide what te think

Bemays states, “We are governed, our minds are molded, aur tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by
men we have never heard of. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live

Based on these Heat that the public opinion can be modified, and that such sha
