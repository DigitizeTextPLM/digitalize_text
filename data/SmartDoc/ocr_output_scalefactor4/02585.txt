1 Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry as well as its reception the concept can be
examined chronologically, from its pre-conditions, thraugh its generation, to its subsequent impact. The idea of
the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, is developed through insights into the mechanical re-
production of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music, but also to Hollywood
movies. That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies.

Adomo was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin
never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hanna Arendt, Adorno
became in effect Benjamins only pupil. After Benjamin's death “it was Adorno who then introduced a rational-
ized version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (ager, 2004, p, 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had
an impact on the development of Adomes thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began
teaching at the Institute, Ademo lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi
party, Horkheimer bad already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began
operating there. The Magis rise to pawer not only meant that Adorno lost his job and would eventually force his
departure from Chermany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jigen Habermas would Later note, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe-
riences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production
éf mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48).

Adorno was at Cocford from 1934 to 1938, where he worked on a manuseripton Husserl. He was considered

an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, ane be looked forward to joining his Frank-
furt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the late
1930s Adomo evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
(930s, Benjamin and Adome debated mass culture, since film and radia became the feo meal poqular means.
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships, The essay translated as “On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regrestion in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Artin the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
rary problem for Adomo lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard over the radia, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result waa inferior to the
original, and Adomea was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “To r
with spart and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adomo, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation fram hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adora, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticin, To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order fram the top-the original or Idea. to down of layers of imitations; to Adorm, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity, The general atitede of the Frankfurt school
wos that af Adore. In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
lnstitute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in
Mew York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, ron by Poul Lazars-
feld, Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although he later claimed that be did not know what a “radio project” was, For his part,
Lazarsfeld looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be an expert on music. Adorno
wrote for the Projest’s journal in 1941, reiterating his position that radio was only an image of & live perfor-
mance. In addition, he questioned the claim by the radia industry that the medium was bringing seriqus music
to the masses ( Wiggershaus, 1904, p. 243). While warking al the Princeton Radio Research Project Adora
became shocked af the degree to which culture had become commercialieed in the United States,

Adarno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 123, and the two theorists became frends. Since Benjamin
never recelved a depres that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorn
became in effect Benjamins only pupil. After Benjamin's death “it was Adorno who then introduced a tational-
ized version of his ideas into aeodemic philosophy.” (ager, 201M, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had
an impact af the development of Adomos thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adame began
teaching at the Institute. Adomo lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Maxi
party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switrerland, and the Institute bepan
aperating there.
