Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural linguistics
To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, he systematic system and the variation
by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set
of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which compose
it; aS opposed to it, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language” (Barthes, 1967,
p.13). Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level,
langue, is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized.
On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However,

it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the
shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of
language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one
wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social insti-
tution, In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech Is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code

of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought It is because speech is

essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds te and individual act and not to a pure

creation. (Barthes, 1947, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which ig expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English of in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog, Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified fsignifié) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 7959. in R_ Innis
(ed.}, p. 37). The correspondence of the conce ptimeaning to the external form is nat im the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It ig nat the inevitable internal relation but the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) arques that “language does
not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from
within itself through 4 series of canceptual and phonic differences”. According ta Saussure, "meaning
is produced through @ process of selection and combination of sig ng along two axes, the syntagmanc
(ea. a santence) and the paradigmatic (€.9., synonyms), orga nized nto a signifying system’ (Barker,
2002, p. 29). Asa grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a fah aft possible signs that va

be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within tt e
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic pone
members. For an exam ple of the syntagmatic and the paradigm atic, lets pacha he seh

on h the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated only when
