Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a basic human function in
which Individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. incer-
tainty Reduction theory (URT), sccredited to Charles R, Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1973), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development of URE, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersanal coommunbestion by examining this significant relationship in uncertainhy
research. Meath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 153), The study of information is basic

reaearch in the field af interpersonal communication, URT places the robe of communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
gbress (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended te employ social psychological theories as starting points” ¢p. 90).
The nsearch underlying the theary and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergenoe of inter-
personal comienunication research; with the development of URT, communication restarchers began to look to
communication for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social
SELCEESs.
