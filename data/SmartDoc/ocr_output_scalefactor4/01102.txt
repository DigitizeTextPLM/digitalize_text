1 Return to Germany

were published without their permission in 1949, Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing
themselves from their own work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the late
1940s the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises in 1951. Horkheimer
became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954 Adorno published an essay
entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of a study that had been done for the
Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner and others. In this essay Adorna
warned, rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed
of psychological control (Adorno, 2001a, p. 160). Tt was one of the few occasions in the 1950s
that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture, At least one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments
of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on oecasion attempt to reshape
his thought on the culture industry, For example, in 1959 he wrote ofa universal pseudo-culture
in the United States (Adorne, 1999, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1965 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film,
Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hobendabl, 1995, p. 131}.

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to
other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609), Instead of culture serving
ideclogical ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into maze society [Heitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affuence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main obpectives were bo
maintain social control and continue te perpetuate the ideology that malotained that control.
Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions
(Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, it ls difficult in Marcuses arguinent to separate culture
or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass
media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adarne
had done, In the ead Marcuses analysis of seclety allowed for ne opposition to the dominant
ideclogy. Marcuse wrote, â€œhow can the aciministered incividualswho have made their nvutilation
into their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged scaleliberate
themselves from themselves as well os fran their masters? How is it even thinkable that the
Vicious circle be broken? (Marcuse, 1001, p. 251). Given the pessimistic tone of the book,
it is somewhat traoke that Jangely because of it he would be perceived as an leon for leftist
movements of the 18605 in the U.S. ond (Germany that developed an oppositional stance,
In spite of this, Marcuse maintained that he was a philosopher, and not an activist. Like others
waociated with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of the idea that theory could be translated
inte practhee (Chambers, 2004, p. 226).

In reviewing the text in 1961, Friedrich Pollack reported to Adorno and Horkhelmer that the
work required too much revision te Teceive mass dissemination. The two authors continued to
negotiate with the Fischer publishing house until 1969, and may have only agreed to republish
the work since pirate copies bad already been disseminated by individuals.
