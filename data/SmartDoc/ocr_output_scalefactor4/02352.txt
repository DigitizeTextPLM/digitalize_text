Uses and Gratifications

1.1. Introduction

Uses and graiifications approach is an inflwential tradition in media research. The ofigenal
conception of the approach wat based on the research for explaining the great appeal of
cenain media contents, The core question of such research ic Why do people ue media
and what do they use them for? (MoQuail 1993), There exists a basic idea in this approach:
sudienes menibers ioncw media content, and which media they can use to meet their needs.
In the mass communication process, uses and gratifications approach puts the function of
inking need gralifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience members. It
Suggests that poople’s needs influence whal media they would choose, how they use oer-
jain media and what grafiicalions the media give them. This approach differs from other
theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences a6 actve media users a& oppoded bo
paseive receivers of information. In contrast to traditional media effects theories which focus
on “what media de bo pecele” and assume audiences are homogeneous, uses and gratifina-
fons approach is more concemed with “wha peogle do with media” (Katz, 1959). Wi alicws
audiences personal needs bo use media and responds bo ihe media, which Gebenmned by
their social and psychological background. Uses and gratificalions approach also postulates
that the media compete with other information sources for audience's need satisfaction (Katz
etal, 1974a). As braditional mass media and mew media continue to provide people wilh a
wide range of media platfonns and content, if is considered one of the moat appropriate
perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be exposed to differant.

The approach emphasizes audiences’ choice by assessing their reasons for using
a certain media to the disregard of others, as well as the various gratifications obtained
from the media, based on individual social and psychological requirements (Severin
5 Tatkerd, (997). Asa broader perspective among communication rasearches, it pro-
vides a framework for understanding the processes by which media participants sock
information or content selectively, commensurate with their needs and interests (Katz
etal, 1974a), Audience members then incorporate the content fo fulfill their needs or

to satiety ther interests (Lowery & Nabila, 1983).

1.2 Origin and History

itis well accepted that communication theoras have developed through the realms of pay-
chology and sociology over the past 100 years. With illumed by valuable ideas a well ae
exploring more untilled fields in these two disciplines, researchers elich a series of higher
conceptions of understanding media.
