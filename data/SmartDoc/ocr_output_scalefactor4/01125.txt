1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study

They provide a framework for understanding

of Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 197
i 4as fo
the correlation between media and Witccut pict

1, The audience is conceived as active, i.e., an important part of of mass media use is

assumed to be goal oriented ... patterns of media
--» pat use are shaped by more or les
naan expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience

2. Inthe mass communication process much initiative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on
theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content an attitudes and
behavior.

3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
mass communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs,
and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consump-
tion certainly varies.

4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- Le., people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in

i cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms. (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous Tesearches on
pratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people on the media, they did not address the
connections between these pratifications (Katz et al., 1974a). They suggested that uses and gratiti-
