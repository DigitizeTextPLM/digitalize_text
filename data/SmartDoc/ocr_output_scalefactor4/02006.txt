Other Propaganda Theorists

1.1 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In

the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content rf ¥ i ayaa
defined as, "...the investigation of communication messages by categorizing rane te Pe EINE eae f
sh order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled “Contents af ree _
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take inte account the frequency a which aap
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, an
the intensity of the svmbols used, By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1945) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence that runs from control to content and from content
to audience” [p. *4) :

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects” (p. 84). Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the
remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar ta Lippmann's theories.

1.2 Ectward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Echward Bernays ( LES1-1593) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bemays (1928)
defines propaganda a5, a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relarions of a
public to an enterprise, idea, or growp (p. 25). Contrary to other propapanda theorists, Bemays recognizes
that propaganda can be elther beneficial or harmful to the public. It can help individuals decide what to think

about or alter the Opinions oF individuals, but this may ae tually he beneficial to society's functioning as a whole

Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be modified, and that such shaping is a necessary part « f
society, Bernays pursued his work in the fleld of public relations. "Public relations : 5Sary pan o
