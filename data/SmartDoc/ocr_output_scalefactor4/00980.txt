I, NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic assumptions were stated ina spady of Kar, Alomler, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows.
Ther poovic a framework for understanding the comelation between media and audiences:

1. The audience is conceiwed a5 active, Le, an important pact of of mass media use is
msumed to be goal oriented ... pattenns of media use are shaped by more or bess
definite expectations of what certain bands of content have co offer the audience
member,

2. [nthe mass Communication process much ininacive im linking need gratification and
Media choice lies with the audience member. This places a sirong limitation om
theorizing abour acw fon of straight-line effect of media content on attibodes and
behavior.

4. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
TSS COIMUNLC ation Constitute bul 4 segment of the wikker range of Barnam nevdds,
and the degree io which they can be adequarely met through mass media consump.
tion certainly varies.

4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use cam be derived
trom data supplied by individeal audience members themselves- ie, peaple
are sufficiently sell-aware to be able be report their intereses and meaives im
Partiqular cases, or at least bo recognize them whem confrented with them in am
indtelligihbe and Camaliar verbal formulation. |

3. Valor judgements about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience orkentations are egplired on their cw terms. (p 15-17)

Jap ey In addition, Kav, Blumer, aod Gurevich 460 commented thal, also previous researches on &
gratifications detected diverse gratificatiors thar amact people onthe media, they did not address che j
connections between these gratifications (Katz et al., 1974a). They suggested that uses and gratifi-
cations research comers with allowing aspects: “(1) the social and che paychological origins af (2)
needs which genera (3) mopectacions of (4) the mass media or other sources which bead to (5) dif-
ferential exposure [or engaging im other activities). resulting in (6) need gratification and (7) other
cOMequences, perhaps oly aniniered ones” (Ratt etal, [74h p 20) The snidies of Fate and
his colleagues laid a cheoretical foandaiton of buclding the uses and gratification approach. Since
them, the research on this sadject has been sirengihened acd extended, The current stapos of wees and
gratificetions is sill based an Kate's first analvsis, particularly as new media forms have emerped in
such an electronic information age when people have more options of media use.

1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-peroeived nowds of audience mem-
bers, Blumer ane Katz (1974) concluded that different people can wee the same comevonication mes-
sage for very different purposes, The same media contem may gratify different needs for different
individaals. There is not only one way chat people uses media. Contrarily, chere are as many reasons
for using the media as there ace mecha users (lumber & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, socio! stuotion, and the individual's harkground, such as experience, interests, andl
education, affect peopfe § ideas abou what they want from anediq and which media best meer thik
feeds, Thar is, audieser members are aware of and can steve their own mothers ond gratification:
for using efferent media. cual, Blur, arid Brow (1972) ropased @ mo of “imedosperson
