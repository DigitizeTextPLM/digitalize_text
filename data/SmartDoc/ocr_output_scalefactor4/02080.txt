production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity, The general attitude of the Franikfurt school

Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in
New York, obtained a position for Adoron al the Princeton Radio Research Project, run by Paul Lazars-
feld, Adorna, anxious tr leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, uccepted
the position, although he later claimed that he did not know what a “ratte project” was. Por his part,

wrote for the Project's journal in 1941, reiterating his position that radio was only an image of a live perfor-
mance, In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio industry that the medium. was bringing serious music
to the masses (Wiggershaus, 994, p, 243). While working at the Princeton Radi Research Project Adora
hecame shocked at the degree to which culture had become commercialized in the United States.

‘Adomo was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorssts became friends. Since Benjamin
never received a degree: that would allow bim to teach at a university, according to Fisanah Arendt, Adarno
became in effect Benjamins only pupil, After Benjamin's death “was Adoma who then introduced a ratioesl-
ined version of his ideas into academic philesophy.” (ager, 204, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjasnin had
an impact on the development af Adamos thought during this period. Returning © Frankfurt, Adomo began
