Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist soclety into a systematic context, as opposed to
ather writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggerstians, 1994, p. 600). Instead of culture serving
ideclogical ends, for Marcuse sovial control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
wAuence that kept elements of society satished and quiescent [Alway, 1995, p. 83). The
entirety of seclety had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were to
maintain social control and contliue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control

Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
af mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions
(Marcuse, 101, p. 8). However, it is difficult in Marcuses argument to separate culture
or mass media from socely as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass
imeclis as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adora
had done. In the end Marcuses analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant
ideology, Marcuse wrote, "how can the administered individualswho have made their mutilation

themselves from themselves as well as from thelr masters? Hew is it even thinkable that the
vicious circle be broken? (Marcuse, 1991, p. 251). Given the pessimistic tone of the hook
