According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process fi as evstem. An Innovation

(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theary, Time variable
is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable 15 involved in diffusion int (1}
the innovation-decision process: (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption, Diffusion research has attempted ta explain the variables
that influence haw and why users and audience adopt a new information medium, such as the /afernet,
Ai cording fo evolution of media technology, Interpersonal influences are important even though in the
past the individual is usually the unit of analysis. Als, critical mass becomes an Important factor in
adopting new media because new media are interactive tools and thus are required by many users to
gain efficiency, That is, the pore people we, fhe more Peon per benefits. Jn this sense, diffusion
theary net only can apply to practical things, but also can be related to digital divide

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
“(1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Lageards (traditional) (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure | shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories
follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped. Source by www2.gsueduwwwitr/docs/dif-
fusion! Figure 2 shows that an innovation would spread through society over various periods of time in
a S-shaped curve. However, as noted above, different types of innovations { é.g., the rate of tetracycline
adoption is faster than that of the hybrid seed com) can have their own different rates in diffusion, Fig-
