ee adil (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on
conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda,
and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Laswell is. credited with creating
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis can be
defined as, "che investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classifications
in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994), In an essay entithed “Contents of Communication,”
Lasswell (1946) explains that a contemt analysis should take into account the frequency with whieh certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that runs from control to content and from content
to audience” (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1954) early definition of communication which
stated, “Wha says what in which channel to whom and with what effects” (p. 84). Content analysis wat essen-
tially ihe says what part of this definition, and Lasewell went on oo do a bot of work within this area during the
remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the convent of propaganda, Laswell was also inverested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept i. However, in is still chat information that it affecting their decisions within

the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories,

1.2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

Ad approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and

Edward Beemays (1091-1995) was examining public relations, propagancla, and public opinion, ma iy

that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public. It can help individuals decide what to think
