4 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1872 English-language translation marked the first rea! appearance of the idea of the

culture industry outside of a German canbext. In fhe years since ere awe been numet-

cus criticanns of the text, nod least since Adore made swe pir) generalizations abaut “the
commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1996, p. 17 3). For the
generally aymeathatic Deborah Cock, Adamo erred in mot discussing the processes of cul
tural production, ard failed 1 examine the culture industry's economic dependence on osner
business sectars, including marketing ard advertising (Cook, 1986, p. 43).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adarna and Marcuse overestimated the daminant ideology, be
lieving that “capitalisl society languishes in the grip of an all-perrab ee resicalion” (Eagietan,
1991, p. 46) Shll, Eagleton conceded that “the diffuseon of dominant values and beliels
ameang copressed peoples i sackely has some parl to play In the reproduction of the ey5-
jem aé a whole” (Eagleton, 1997, 9 36), Fredric Jameton pointed ‘oui that Adamo idea
of a culture industry wars historically limited, since the society fat developed in the 1960s
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibiibes available during the 13408.
While the ides of the ciumure indisery an be defended a6 a useful theary for industrial scr

dominant declogy can co-opt macennist works for iis cwn ends. The dea of the comune
industry has had an importance in critical theory Since ils appearance in the 72406, in that
it has led fo thought about the role of mass communications in retation to ideology, and
hence, soaety Since Adorna made sweeprig generalizations about the impact of the culture
industry, ard since he did not syslamatically explore haw the cufure industry operated, it has
been generally easy for some to dismiss the idea of a culture indushy. lis nonetheless the
case that motion pictures afe still made by large companies and that thelr movies largely rety
on formulaic plots. tis alto the case that radio is increasingly contralled by a small number
of compara, which tend to impose resinichons on how stabons operale. As a broadcast
medium, television is very much retabed ta both radio and film, and shares with them qualities
that situation fin the cullure industry. While there is a demacratizing aspect ta the Internat
(in that anyone can creale a web site), it happens that the commercial companies operating
on the Internet continue to maintain an ideological function. For example, one sekom sees
new slories on MSNBC or Yahoo that would question the prerogatives of comorate America
A reexamination of the idea of the culture indushy may be necessary in order ta theertna of
how mags communication media propagain dominant ideologies.
