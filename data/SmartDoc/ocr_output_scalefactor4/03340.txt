ized version of his ideas into academic philoso phy.” Qiger, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had
an impact of the development of Adornos thought during this period, Returning to Frankfurt, Adame began
teaching at the Institute. Adomo lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nini
party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switverland, and the Institute bean
operating there. The Nazis rise to power not only meant that Adorno lost his job and would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jircen Habermas would later note, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe-
riences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 4).

. 1 Almeady im the late
1930s Adomo evidenced lithe hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adotmo debated mass culture, since film and radio became the bwo most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships, The essay translated as “Gin the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's nore
optimistic essay, “The Work of Artin the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adormo lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adento was emphatic in his condemnation of ihe mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adomo, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film

as the emancipation trom hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adorno, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea- to down of layers of imitations; to Adorno, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adore, In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working im

New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, run by Paul Lazars-

feld. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted

the position, although he later claimed that he did not know what a “radio project” was. ce a par

Lazarsteld looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be an expert on music. Adomo

wrote for the Project's journal in 1941, reiterating his position thal radio was only an male ofa live perfor-

mance. In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio ind ustry that the medium was bringing serious music
te the masses (Wiggershaus, 1994, p, 243). While working at the Princeton Radio Research Project Adora
became shocked at the degree to which culture had become commercialized In the United States, Ra
