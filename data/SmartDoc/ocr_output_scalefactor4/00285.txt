1, THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in
Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative
in Europe, The cloeest thing in Adornos experience to the advertising industry in the United States
was fascist propaganda (JHger, 2004, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience with
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industey by noting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). [t became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did
not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adornos dissatisfaction with
the work of the Princeton Padio Hesearch Project would eventually motivate him to further develop
the idea of the culture industry.

Becouse of the relotionahin between the Inetitute for Social Research and Columbia [niversity,
florkheimer, who fed already moved to California, could nat bring Adorno to the West Comef andl
Nowember J5j2. When Adorno wos finally able to relacate, he joined an expatriofe commnnity pat
included Frits Long, Arnold Schoenberg, Hons Eisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Dablin, and
Bertolt Brecht, several of sohich found work in the Holijeeod mowe industry. The fact Sat Adorne
wae port of this intellectual community whose members were involved in the production af Hollywood
movies mast hone kod some influence in deceloping Ai thoughts on culture, since the Holigaod aysten
inhilited the creatine freedom that many of the expatriates Aad enjoyed in Weimar Germany.

These preconditions Adorned interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, as well os involvement with the expatriate community in California and the
relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important to an understanding of
his concern for the idea of the culture inclustry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

Por Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did mot bother to present itself ae art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkhetemer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95), This busiwess was based on what Adora rederred to as Fordist
capitaligm, in which oss production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural spleere, Insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy ([Hohendahl,
1905, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adotmowere the Hollywood production system, or
the CHS radia network that had been associated with the Princeton Hadio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplanta the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
2002, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system,
and that nothing truly adversarial te the system would emerge (Horkbeimer and Adotno, 2002, p.
16-7). Paradoxically, any innovntion would only reaffirm the system, and Adomme cited Oren Welles
a8 an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would
allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineAectyal
[Frieliman, 1081, p, D66). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
of social control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to chooee in a system of economic
coprcon whimately meant the freedom to be the came (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 136).

Since Adorno bad been, in bis essays on mitsic and radio, an apparent defender of high art, The
Culture Industry has been criticized as being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture.
Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry [Horkheimer and
Adorno, 2002, p. 101). It was oot high art that Aclorno was presenting 48 an alternative to the culture
industry, but modernism, Although he provides the idea of an oppeding force to the culture industry,
Adotno provides na overt Marxist analysis. Instead, he notes in possing that the dominant system
Utilized capacities for mass consumption for entertainment or amusement,

Since Adotno had been, in his says on music and radio, an Spparent defender of high art, The
Culture Industry hes been criticized as being a defense of high art, as oppoced to popular culture.
Adorno specifically defined avant-garde art a8 the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and
Adorno, 2002, p. 11}.
