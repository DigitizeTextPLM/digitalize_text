4 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culture industry outside of a German context. In the years since there have been numer
aus criticisms of the text, not least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about ‘the
commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adorno erred in nat discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic depe ndence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the daminant ideology, be-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification’ (Eagleton,
1991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that "the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys-
fem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36). Fredic Jameson pointed out that Adorno s dea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the 1960s
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1940s
While the ides of the culture industry can be defanded as a useful theory for industrial soci-
eties between 1920 and 1870, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl
1995, p. 146-48). Thus, fora some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry would
appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value at all.

Thus for some critics modermist works would be counteracting forses against the daminant
declogy. AS noted in ihe example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case that the
dominant ideclagy can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of the culture
industry has had an importance in critical theory since its appearance in the 1940s, in that
has hed to thought about the role of mass communications in rélation ta ideology, and
hence, society. Since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about the impact of the culture
industry, and since he did net éysiematically explore how the culture industry operated, it has
been generally easy for some to dismiss the idea of a culture industry. It is nonetheless the
case that rman pictures are still made by large companies and that their movies largely rely
on formulaic plots. Itis also the case that radio is increasingly controlled by @ small number
of companies, which tend to IMpose restrictions on how stations operate. As a broadeast
medium, television is very much related to both radio and film, and shares with them qualitias
that situation it in the culture industry. While there is 4 democratizing aspect to the Internat
