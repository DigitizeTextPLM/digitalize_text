way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to tee
and alee apprehensive to accept it. However, it is sil] that information that is affecting their decisioes within

the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann's thearies. ;

1.2) Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1691-1995) was examining public relalons, propaganda, and public opinion, Bernays (128)
defines propaganda a5, a combistent, enduring effort ta create ar shape ewents to influence the relations of a
public to an enterprise, idea, or group (p. 25). Contrary ta other propaganda theorists, Bermays recognizes
thar propaganda can be either beneficial ar harmful to the public. It can help individuals decide what ta think
about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial ta society's funcihoning asa whale.

together as a smoothly functioning society (p. 9).
Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be modified, and that such shaping is a necessary part of

society, Bemays purawed his work in the field of public relations. "Public relations is the antempt, by information,
persuasion, asd adjustment, to engineer public support for.an activity, cause, movement, or institution’ (Bernxys,
1955, p. 3} Jn the Engineering of Cansent, Bermays 7955) lays out the framework for understanding the pubiie
and developing 2 public relations campaign. Bernays (1955) claims that ihe key toa successful public relations
