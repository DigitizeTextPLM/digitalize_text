1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

bis 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
several outside of a German context. In the years since there have been numer-
gine ee bis not least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about “the

etishized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, be-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton,
1991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys-
tem as a whole" (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adomo’s idea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the 1960s
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1940s.
While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial saci-
eties between 1920 ana 4970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hahendahl.

4995, p. 146-48). Thus, fora some critics, the value of the Kea of the culture industry would
appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value at all.
Thus for some critics modernist works would be counteracting forces against the dominant
ideology. As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case that the
dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of the culture
