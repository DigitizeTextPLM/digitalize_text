1 Other Propaganda Theorists

L1 Harold Laswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In
fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself
(Rogers, 1994).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused an
conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda,
ared discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 194). Lasswell is credited with creating
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis can be
defined as, "...the investigation of communication mestages by categorizing message content into classifications
in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled “Contents of Communication,”
Lasewell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear ina message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content af the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that runs from control to content and from concent
to audience” [p. Fa.

This method of conbent analysis is thed strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, "Who says what in which channel ta whom and with what effects" (p. 84), Content analysis. was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell weot on to do a lot of work within this area during the

remainder af his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was alsa interested In how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is Limited in the information that is presented to them,

and algo apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way al viewing
the power of the media that ls somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories.

12 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1991-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays (1928)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effect to create or shape events to influence the relations of a
public to an enterprise, idea, or group ip, 25). Contrary to acher propaganda theorists, Bernays recognizes
that propaganda can be elther beneficial or harmful ta the public. It can help individuals decide what to think
about or alter the apinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to society's functioning a5 a whole.
Bermays states, "We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by
men we have never beard af. Vase nombers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live
together 24 a smooehly functioning society {p. 9).

Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be modified, and that such shaping is a necessary part of
society, Bernays purswed his work in the fleld of public relations. “Public relations & the sttemp, by information,
persuasion, ard adjustment, to engineer public support foran activity, cause, Movement or institution” (Remays,
1955, p. 3), Inuke Engineering of Consent, Bernays (1535) loys out the fromework for understanding the public
and developing a public relations campaign, Bernays (1955) claims that the key to a successful public relations
campaign [5 adjuioment of the campaign to ihe attitudes af various praups in society, gathering information
in effectively express an idea, and finally, utilizing persuasion to influence the public opinion in the intended
direction.

Bemays" theories represent a step forward for mass communication theory, They move away from more
typical presentations of “hit-ar-miss propaganda,” ard move toward a deeper
