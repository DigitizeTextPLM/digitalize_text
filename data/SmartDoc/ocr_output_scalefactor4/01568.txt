operating there, The Nazis rise to power not only meant that Adorno est his job ancl would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jirgen Habermas would later note, the
fact that lahor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe-
riences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 44). :
Adorno was at Chcford from 1934 ¢o 1938, where he worked on a manuscript on Husserl. He was considered
an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frank-
furt Schoal colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the late
1930s Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda ond entertainment increased during the
1920s, Benjamin and Adomo debated mass culture, since film and radia became the tao most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “Cn the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistt essay, “The Work of Arm inthe Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 195%, p. 62) A pri-
mary problem for Adorno lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a comeert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph recomds. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adora was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adomo, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
a8 the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adom, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic ander from the top-the original or Idea= to down of layers of imitations; to Adomo, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adomo. In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succecding it éslablishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in
Sew York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, run by Paul Lazars-
feld. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of bring with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although he later claimed that be did mot know what a “radio project" was. For his part
Lazarsteld looked forward to warking with Adorno, whom be knew to be an expert on music. Lane
wrote for the Project's journal in 1941, reiterating his position that radio was only an image of a live 2
mance. In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio industry that the medium was bringing seriou rae:
