- Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- Le., people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in
Particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation,

Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass Communication should be
suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms. (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous researches an
gratitications detected diverse pratifications that attract people on the media, they did not address the
connections between these gratifications (Katz et al., 197da)j. They suggested that uses and gratifi
cations research concern with following aspects: “(1) the social and the psychological origins of (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) dif
ferential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in (6) Hse aie and (7) other
consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones” (Katz et al., 19746, p. 20). I he studies of Katz and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the uses and gratifications approach, Since
then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. ea ca of uses 7
