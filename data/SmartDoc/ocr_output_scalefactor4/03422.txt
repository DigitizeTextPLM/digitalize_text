bers. Blumler and Katz {19 4) concluded that different people can use the same communication mes

sage for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different
individuals, There is not only one way that people uses media. Contrarily, there are as m ahi ieee
for using the media as there are media users (Blurnler & Katz, 1974)

for using different media, MeQuail. Blumer, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of oryica Erected

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was fuggested by McGuire (1974), based
Oona general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective, Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus
“internal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch and Haas
(1972) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
put them inte five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding:

2, Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;

3. Personal integrative needs, including creaibility, stability. status;

4. Sociol integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends; and

5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.
