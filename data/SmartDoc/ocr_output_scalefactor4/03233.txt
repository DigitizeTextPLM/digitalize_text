1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture an fbn and radio did nat bother to present itself as art. They were instead
a business, and this in tarn became an ideolagy to legitimize the trash they intentionally pracuce
{Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 94). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl,
1895, p. 142). Examples of thisnet specified by Adormowere the Hollywood production syetem, or
the CHS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula eupplanta the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
S002, p. SO). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the sysbers,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the evetem would emerge (Horkheimer and Adamo, 2002, p.
106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaftiom the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles
a2 an example of someone whe was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would
allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual
(Friedman, 1981, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
of social control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of economic
coercion ultimately meant the freedom to be the same (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 136).
