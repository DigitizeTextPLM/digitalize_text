J. GEASS OF “TALE CULT LE INOUST AE"

1 Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

En order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry as well as its reception the concept can be
examined chronologically, fram its pre-conditions, through its generation, to its subsequent impact. The idea af
the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, is developed through insights Into the mechanical re~
production of culture, and is ultimately) pemerated in opposition mat only to popular music, but alsoto Hollyweead
movies, That this is so grows out of.a number of historical contingencies.

Adomo was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two thearists became friends. Since Benjamin
never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adarna
became in effect Benjamins only pupil. Agter Benjamin's death “it was Adome who then introduced a ralional-
ized version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (ger, 2004, p. 65-4). The relationship with Benjamin had
an impact on the development of Adormas thought during this period, Returning t Frnkfurt, Adome began
tenching at the [nstitute. Adomo lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi
party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switeerland, ond the Institute began
operating there. The Nazis rise to power not only meant that Adore lost his job and would eventually force his
departure fram Germany, but also affected his philesephical thought, As tigen Habermas would later note, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe~
riences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48).

‘Adorno wns at Chofoed from 193-4 to 1998, where he worked on a manuscript on Husserl, He was considered
an outsides, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frank-
furt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. Adready in the late
1930s Adorno evidenced little bope for mass culture, As propaganda and entertainment increased during the:
(920s, Benjamin and Adome debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means

to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “Cm the Fetish
Charseter in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adomo lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard aver the radia, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adorna was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adorno, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destrection of aura by photograph or film

as the emancipation fram hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adomo, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity. Ta Benjamin, the mechanical repreduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea~ to down of layers of imitations; to Adora, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
wae that of Adora. Im 1998 Max Horkbeimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continge working in
New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, ran by Paul Lazars-
feld. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although be later claimed that he did not know what a “radin project" was, For his part,
Lazarsfeld looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be an expert on music, Adomo
wrote for the Project’s journal in 1941, reiterating his pasition that radio was only an image of a live perfor-
mance. In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio industry that the medium was bringing seriqus music
to the masses (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 243). While working at the Princeton Radio Research Project Adorno
became shocked at the degree to which culture had become commercialized in the United States.

Adore was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin

ized version of his ideas inte academic philosophy.” (ager, 2004, p. 63-6), The relationship with Benjamin had
an impact on the development of Adomos thought during this period. Retuming to Frankfurt, Adore began
teaching at the Institute. Adomo lost his right to teach in September 1933 duc to the rise to power of the Nazi
party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began
operating there,
