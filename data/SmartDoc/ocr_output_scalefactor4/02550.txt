On the contrary, parole is flexible because itis the actual expression
it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the

shared convention, the structure.

rasists the modifications corning from a single individual and is consequently a social instl-
tution. In contrast te language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because epaech is
essentially a combinative activity that if corresponds to and individual act and nol to a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausune distinguishes the language system into two parts, tha
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form,
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English of in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. “| propose to retain the word sign (signe) te
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa.
fates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis
fed.), p. 37). The correspondence of the conceplmeaning to the external form is rot in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. tis not the inevitable intemal relation but the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that “language does
not reflect a pre-existent and extemal reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from
within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences”. According to Saussure, “meaning
ls produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic
6.9. a sentence! and the paradigmatic (6.9. synonyms), organized into a signifying system” (Barker,
2002, p. 29). As 4 grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. Foran example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the follaw-
ing sentence: "I went to a theater with my girlfriend." This sentence is established through the
linear combination of signe. The signs within the éxample, such as | theater, my, and girlfriend can be
substituted for by other signs in thet paradigmatic, such as “She wentto a relat Ranenatie her =a "
Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that SI9NS are operated only raed
they ere related to each other. “Crucially, signs do not make sense by virtue of reference to enti
