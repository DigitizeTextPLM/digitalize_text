1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Losewell, Eltul, and Bernays are important for a number of
raaona, Based on the ideas of his predecessora, Lippmann wae able to bring attention to the fact that

The theorles presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the direct effects and limited effects
media models. ‘Theorlsts such as Ellul tended to cide heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
propaganda could directly influence the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, theorists uch sa Lippmans
also noted that the media might not be influencing only thought, but may also be influencing what
people thought about. lt was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting point for future eh
in the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work of
Tyengar and Kinder, as well as MeCombs and Shaw. Overall, the research of the scholars pain i
this paper has been very important to the widerstanding of the media, the manipulation of ; ey
and the formation af public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell Sih ra
