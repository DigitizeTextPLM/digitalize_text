one “tasteless demonstration’ in which three females bared their breasts. Adorno died a few

1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culture industry outside of a German context. In the years since there have been numer-

ous criticisms of the text, not least since Adomo made sweeping generalizations about “the
commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cul-

tural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, be-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification" (Eagleton,
1991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys-
tem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adorno's idea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the 1960s
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available du ring the 1940s.
While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial soci-

eties between 1920 and 1970. trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl.

1995. p. 146-48). Thus, fora some critics. the value of the idea of the culture industry would

appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value at all,
Thus for some critics modernist
