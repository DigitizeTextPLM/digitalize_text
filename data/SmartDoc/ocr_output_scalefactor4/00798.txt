‘According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation fs comm
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. oa Tonaratlonn
is an idea, practice or object perceived as mew by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
sion of innovations invelves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass COmmu-
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful, Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed a3 five parts, §-M-C-R-E
(eg., sender-message-channel-receiver-effeet). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this $-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be

lor mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of # social system, and finally
(3) the effects can be individual's adoption oF social change. In the diffusion theory, “Time’ Variable

is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1993), time variable is invelved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inma=
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption, Diffision research has attempted fo explain the variables
that inf uence how and why wers and audience adapt anew information medium, such as the Internet.
According to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even though in the
past the individual is uswally the writ of analysis, Also, critical mass becomes an iniportartt factor in
adopting new media hecauze new media are interactive tools and thus are required by many users to
gain efficiency. That is, the more people use, the more people get benefits. Je this sense, diffusion
theary not only can apply to practical things, dad also con be related to digital divide.

There ane five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
“1 Innovators (ve nturesome)., (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (2) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Lageanrds (traditionaly” (Rowers, 1995, pp, 183-185). Rogers defined
this teom as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure | shows the relationships between types

aya fe bbe comes to the process of innovation-decisions, Rogers (1995) mentioned that

l. Knowledge + of ~ (selective exposure or awareness of news)

2. Altitudes + or — (people have positive or negative attitude toward innovations)

3. Adoption (Decision): people decide to adopt the innevation
4. Implementation (regular or standard practice)

3. Confirmation (comparing and evaluating)
