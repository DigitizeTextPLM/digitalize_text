Uses and Gratifications

1.1 Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach Is an influenti ition i i
conception of the approach was based on a lect pies depen eae
certain media contents. The core qu r TL bat "s
question of such research is: Why do people use mecia
and what do they use them for? (McQ uail, 1983). There exists a basic idea in this approach
audience members know media content, and which media they can use to meet their needs
In the mass communication process, uses and gratifications approach puts the function of
linking need gratifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience members. It
suggests that people's needs influence what media they would choose, how they use cer-
tain media and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs from other
theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users aS opposed to
passive receivers of information, In contrast to iraditional media effects theories which focus
on “what media do to people’ and assume audiences are hamogeneous, uses and gratifica-
tions approach Is more concerned with “what peaple do with media” (Katz, 1959). lt allows
audiences personal needs ta Use media and responds to the media, which determined by
their social and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates
that the media compete with other information sources for audience's need satisfaction (Katz
etal, 1974a). As traditional mass media and new media continue to provide people wilh a
wide range of media platforms and content, it is considered one of the most appropriate
perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be exposed to diferent :
The approach emphasizes audiences’ choice by assessing a Sipe silent tae:
acertain media to the disregard of others, as well as the various gratifications obtained
from the media, based on individual social and psychological requirements poeta
rd, 1997). Asa broader perspective among com munication researc 1s. apt

media participants seek

it al., 19744) Audience members then incorporate the content to fulfill their needs or
to satisty their interests (Lowery & Nabila, 1983).
