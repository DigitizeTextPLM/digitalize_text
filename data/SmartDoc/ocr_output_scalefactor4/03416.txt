Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry as well as its reception the concept can be
examined chronologically, from its pre-canditions, through its veneration, to ils subsequent impact. The idea at
s developed through insights into the mechanical re-

the culture industry grows out of a concem with culture
nnotonly to popular music, but also to Holly wiend

production of culture, and is ultimately generated in oppositio
movies. That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies.

Adome was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends, Since Benjamin
never received a degree that would allow him to teach at 8 university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno
became in effect Benjamins only pupil, After Benjamin's death “it was Adema whe then intreduced a rational-
ized version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (Jager, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had
an impact on the development of Adornos thought during this period, Returning t Frankfurt, Adomo began
teaching at the Institute. Adorno lost his night to teach in September (993 due to the rise to power of the Nazi
party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began
operating there. The Nazis rise to power not only meant that Adom Lost his job and would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jtirgen Habermas would later note, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe
riences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48).

1930s Adore evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's mare
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adorno lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed ina concert hall. sym phonic works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adorno was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile miliew
impossible” (Adomo, 2001b, p. 47), While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adorno, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea- to down of layers of imitations; to Adormo, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adem. In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in
New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Frinceton Radio Research Project, run by Paul Lazars-
feld. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although he later claimed that he did not know what a “radio project” was. For his part,
Lazarsfeld looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be an expert on music. Adomo
wrote for the Project's journal in 1941, reiterating his position that radio was only an image of a live perfor-
mance, In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio industry that the medium was bringing serious music
to the masses (Wiggershaus, 1994, p, 243). While working at the Princeton Radio Research Project Adorno
hecame shocked at the degree to which culture had become commercialized in the United States.

Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin
never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, aceording to Hannah Arendt, Adore
became in effect Benjamins only pupil. After Benjamin’s death “it was Adore who then introduced a rational-
ized version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (Jdger, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had
an impact on the development of Adornos thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adomo began
teaching at the Institute. Adomo lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi
party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began

operating there.
