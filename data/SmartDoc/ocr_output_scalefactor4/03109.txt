1. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in

Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative

in Europe. The closest thing in Adornos experience to the advertising industry in the United States
was fascist propaganda (Jager, 2004, p. 122), Adorno was later to allude to his experience with
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did
not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adornos dissatisfaction with
the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop
the idea of the culture industry.

Because of the relationship between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University,
Horkheimer, who had already moved to California, could not bring Adarna to the West Coast uretil
November 1941. When Adorna was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate community that
included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Fuster, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Dabhn, and

Bertolt Brecht, several of which found work in the Hollywood movie industry. The fact that Adorne

was part of this intellectual community whose members were involved in the production af Hollywood

movies must have had some influence im developing his thoughts on culture, since the Follywead system
inhibited the creafive freedom that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Wearnar Germany.

These preconditionsAdornes interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the
relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important to an understanding of
his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did net bother to present iteelfas art. They were Instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 94). ‘This business wae based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used hy Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl,
1995, p. 142). Examples of thisnot apecified by Adernowere the Hollywood production system, oF
the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Ftasearch Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplante the work (Horkheimer and Aderno,
2002, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change bo the syvetent,
