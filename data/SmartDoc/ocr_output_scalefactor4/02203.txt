1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1999)

Leon Festinger studied paychology al. the University of Fowa uneer the dareetion of Kiait pag eres
one of the founders of social psychology and « poceeer in the eet ee ane i
stancial influence om the development af interpersonal communicallon, After graduatzon, nee
worked at ithe University of Rochester, but im 14% he followed Lewin to rae f
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Growp Dynamics. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the Liniversity of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
{Samelson, 2. Mach of Festinger’s research folkrwed his mentor Lewin anid farther developed
Lewis's theories, Several of Festinger theories were highly influcstial om the emerging field od in=
terpersonal communication and on the development of URT. Festinger is best known fie the theories
of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Compares, Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted io
exphin bow an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual, Lewin foreshadowed CII
in his observations regarding attiude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982} CDT allows for three
relationships bo occur among cognitions: & consonant relationship, in which cognilicns are in eqyul-
librium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which oxynitioess are in compelieint with each
other; and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on ome another
(Wea & Turner, 2000), Cognitive Dissonaece, like uncertainty, has an clement af arousal and dis-
comfort that individuals seek oo reduce. Social Compannsen theary postulates chat individuals look bo
feedback from ochers to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual
usually seeks the opinore of others who are similar eo the self. This need for social comparison can
result in conformity pressures (Trenhodm & Jensen, 3M). Berger and Calabrese (1975) related so-
cal compariags ko WRT by siting that “Pestimger has suggested that persons seek oval similar others
who afe prooimane when they experience a hagh level of uncertaingy regarding the approprialeness of
their behavior and‘or opanions ina partecular situation” (p. LOT), Fesinper roceteed the Distinguished
Scientiat award of the Amencan Peycholageal Assecaten and the Distinguished Senior Scbemtist
Award [rom the Society of Experimental Social Peychology, Festimper’s legacy is significant, and
his theoretical influesce con still be recogniged in comemporary soci science research. Aronson (in
Festinger, 15400) stated, “It wos im this ero that Leon Festinger inverted and developed his theory of
cognitive dixsonance, and im my opinion, social psychology kas net been ihe same since™ ip. 3.
