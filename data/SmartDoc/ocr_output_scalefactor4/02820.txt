for cea different media, MeCuail, Mumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person
Interactions” to classify four important media Eratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or
problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal
identity: self reference: reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance (forms of informa-
tion seeking),

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was Suggested by McGuire (L974), based

On 4 general theery of human needs. He distinguished between twa types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus
“aternal" goal orientation, and emotion stability of “grawth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply te media use [Figure 1). Fipure 1.
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974), Katz, Gurevitch and Haas
(1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
put them into five categories:

. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding;
. Affective needs, including entotion, pleasure, feelings;
. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, status;
_ Sacial integrative needs, including Interacting with family and friends, and
Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.
