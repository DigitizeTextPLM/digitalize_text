1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an importam construct, necessary W0 the study of commu

Hicaiban, & would be beneficial to know when The OUnCept origimateal, and how it has been defined

and stadied. One way to consider uncertainty is throagh the theoretical framework of information

theory. Shannon and Weaver (1545) proposed that uncertainty existed ie a given sitestion when there

was 2 high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal,

expanded the concepd af uncertainty to fit interpersonal comenanication by defining uncertainty as

the “number of alternative ways im which each interaciant might behave" (p. 100). The greater the
Jevel of uncertainty that exists in a sinaation, the smaller the chance individaals will te able to pre-
dict behaviors and occurrences. Quring imeractians individuals are not only faced with problems of
predicting present amd past behaviors, hut also explaining why partners behave or believe im the way
that they do. Berger and Bradac’s (1982) definition of uncertamey highlighved the complexity of this
