itis well accepted that communication theories Have developed through the realms of psychology and s0-
clolaay over the past 100 years. With illumed by valuable ideas.as well as exploring more untilled fields in these
two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding media, As a sub-tradition of
media effects research, uses and gratifications approach is suggested to be originally stemrned fram a func:
tionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). Ta some extent, however, functional theory
On communication agrees with media's effects towards people. For example, a model often used in the the-
ory, the Hypadermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential
effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information into the consciousness of the masses” [Watton & Hill 1997, p.
105). Functional theory influenced studies an communication from the 2920s to the 240s. After that, a shift
which reditcovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses
and gratificatians approach,

The exploration of gratificatians that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as
empirical mass communication research teal? (hocuail, 1983). Gating back to the 19405, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such a5 soap operas and quizzes, as well
as daily newspaper (Lazrsteld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1543; etc). In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specitic content or by the medium
itself (Katz et al, 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice,
support, or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, neéwspaper was abo discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure te the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (144) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 19705 when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one af the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and a3 2 communication researcher, He received his Ph.D. in So-
cinlogy in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government of lirael, Ratz headed the task force charged
with the intreduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in letsure, culture and communication fram the 1970s ta29S0s (UPENN, 2001). In
41992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and alee directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Kate’s mentor in Columba University is Paul Lazarsfeld, who is one ofthe pioneers of pratiications research.
Thair cooperating work produced important qutgrewths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced uses and grattication approach when he came up with the
notion that people use the media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject

fas the uses and gratification: research were explored. They viewed the mass media as a means

their needs more readily than the media overpawer them [Ratz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973).
