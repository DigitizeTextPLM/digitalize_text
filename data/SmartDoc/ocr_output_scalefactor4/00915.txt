1.1) Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong fourdation for communication
research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty, Uueer-
tainty Reduction tear (URT), accredited to-Charkes Bh. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), recognized that
Teducing Uncertainty was a central motive of communication Through the development of RT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research. Heath and Bryant (20810) state: “Ones of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty’ (p. 133). The study of information is basle
to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particqular advanced theoretical
Tesearch in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the role of communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of imerpersenal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1973) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research om the interpersonal

The research underlying the theory are efforts made by other contemporaries marked the envergence of inter-
personal communication research: with the development of URT, communication researchers began to look to
communication for theanes of greater understanding rather than theoretical appronches founded in other social

aciences.
