1. CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public, and the necessity of abtention-generating propaganda in influencing
public opinion (Bernays, 195, p22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrases,
the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is carehul planning more
than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations fren old-time hit or mice publicity aud
propaganda (Hernays, 1956, p.22). Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent different view of

the formation of public opinion. In eppasition ta Lippmann, who views the public a5 being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions againat this. He claima, The public is not an amorphous mast which
can be molded at will or dictated ta (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernaye (1928) offers the idea
that in attempting to influence the public, & busines mst study what terms the partnership can be

public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept [p. fib).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations ms a teal that can be
werd to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situatian, of helps the public adjust to it (Bernays,
1952, p. 0). Hernays view of the public is softer than that af Lippmann, a# he recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important becnuse it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, ta know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts belng made by others,
amd to persuade or suggest courses of action (p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still poesible, it is net in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such a
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion; The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Bilal, ond Bernays are important for a number af
reasons. Based on the ideas of fis predecessors, Lippmann woe able to bring attention fo the fect Wiad
the public ds able to be influenced by the media. The work of bipprann and his colleagues has led to mare
recent redearch that is meond fo help understand the influence of the media on the public. Through the
work fyengar and Hinder, White, Lenin, and MeCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensive understanding
of the media fas been developed. The public has new been mode aware various tmedia functions auch aa

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the direct effects and limited effects
media models. Theorists such as Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
propaganda could directly influence the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippmann
also noted that the media might not be influencing only thought, but may also be influencing what
people thought about, It was this line of thinking that Tesulted in a starting point for future research,
in the ares of the limited efects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work of
Iyengar and Kinder, ae well as McCombs and Shaw. Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in
this paper has been very important to the understanding of the media, the manipulation of the public,
and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul
were formed years ago, they continue to help us understand the society that surrounds us today.
