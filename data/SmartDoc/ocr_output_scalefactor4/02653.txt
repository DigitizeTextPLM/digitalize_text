On the contrary, parole is flexible because i is the actual expression at the individual level. However,
is considered relatively flexible due te the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the
shared convention, the structure.

tution. In contrast to language, which is bath institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speach is
essentially a combinative activity that if corresponds to and individual act and not te a pure:

Focusing on the systematic evel, Sausune distinguishes the language system into two parts, the
signified and the segnifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which ia the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "| propose to retain tne word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating ihe opposition that sepa-

rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts” (Saussure, 1949, in FR. Innis
(ed,), p. 37). The correspondence of the conceptimeaning to the extemal form is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. tis not the inevitable internal relation but the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that “language does
nat reflect a pre-eistant and extemal reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning fram
within itself hrough a series of conceptual and phonic diferences”. According to Saussure, “meaning
is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two ames, the syntagmatic

2002 p. 29) As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
