CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-pgenerating propaganda in influencing
public opinion [Bernaya, 1955, p22), Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase,
the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning. Ard it [s careful planning more
than anything else that distinguishes madern public relations from old-time jut or miss publicity ancd
propaganda (Bernays, 1955, p.22}. Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent 4 different view of
the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, whe views the public as being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an qimorphous mass which
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea
that in attempting to influence the public, Â« business must study what terms the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept {p. G6).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1962). tather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as # tool that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations
man helps his client adjust ta the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it [Hermnays,
1952, p. 0). Bernays view of the public is softer than that af Lippmann, as le recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is posaible. Dermaye (1962) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, 1o evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade or suggest courses of action [p. 10), Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public & still pasible, it le not in such blatant ignorance ef the public opinion. Theariats such as
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion; The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasrwell, Eliul, and Bernays are important for a number af
remeons. Based on the ideas of fia predecessors, Lippmann ants owe bo bring affention to the fact that
the public is ale ta de influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues has fed to mere
recen! regeareh that is mean! fo helo understand the influence af the medio on the public. Through the
work fyengor and Kinder, White, Lewin, and MeCombs and Shaw, a more compreiensive understanding
af the media has been deewloped. The public has now been made owore tarioue media firnctions such as
agenda-setting, gatekeeping, atid priming, and the potential effects that these techniques con have on
their audiences,

The thearies presented in this paper have thed heavily to both the direct effects and limited effects
media models. Chearists such as Ellul tendexd to cide heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
propaganda could directly influence the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippmann
also noted that the media might not be influencing only thought, but may also be influencing what
peaple thought about. [t was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting point for future research
in the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work of
lyengar and Kinder, as well a5 McCombs avd Shaw, Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in
this paper has been very important to the widerstanding of the media, the manipulation of the public,
and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lazswell, Bernaye, and Ellul
were formed years age, they continue to help ws wulerstand the society that surrounds us today,
