In addition, Karz, Alamler, and Gureviteh also commented that, although previous researches on
Sratifications detected diverse gracifirations that amract people an the media, they did not address the
tonnettions between ihese gratifications [Katz et al, 1474a). They suggested chat ees and graiifi-
calions research concer with following aspects: “(1) the social and the peychological origins of (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) dif:
ferential EX pPoOSune (or engaging in other activities), resulting in (h) need gratification and (7) other
consequences, perhape mostly unintended ones" (Katz etal 1874h, p. 20). The studies of Kate and
his collegeues laid a theoretical foundation of Guilding the wees and gratificanons approach. Since
then, the research om this subject has been strengthened and extended. The current tata of uses and

Uses and gratification: approach emphasizes motives and the self-percerved needs of audbence mem:
bers, Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the sar communication mes-
sage for very different purposes. The same media coment may gratify different needs for different
individuals. There is nat only one way that ae Sn al ihere are as many reasons
there are media users (Blumeber & Kate, [%4).
