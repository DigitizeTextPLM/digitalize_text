1. GENESIS OF “THE CULTURE INDUSTRY”

1 Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry as well as its reception the concept can be

examined chronologically, from its pre-conditions, through its generation, to its subsequent impact, The idea of

the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, is developed through insights into the mechanical re-
production of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music, but also to Hollywood
movies. That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies.

Adomo was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin
never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno
became in effect Benjamins only pupil, After Benjamin's death “it was Adorno who then introduced a rational-

ized version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (Jéger, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had
an impact on the development of Adornas thought during this period. Retuming to Frankfurt, Adorno began
teaching at the Institute. Adomo lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi
party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began
operating there. The Nazis rise to power not only meant that Adome lost his job and would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought, As Jiirgen Habermas would later note, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe-

Tiences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production

of mass culture in the Linited States (Morris, 2001, p, 48),

Adorno was at Oxford from 1934 to 1938, where he worked on a manuscript on Husserl. He was considered
an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frank-
furt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the Linited States, Already in the late
19305 Adoma evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the

1930s, Benjamin and Adomo debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “Qn the Fetish
Character in Music and the Reeression in Listening” isi imisti jam
are fgression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art inthe Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999 p. 62). A pri-
