Particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

- Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms. (p. 15-17),

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous researches on
gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people on the media, they did mot address the
connections between these gratiflcations (Katz et al. 1974a). They suggested that uses and gratifi-
Cations research concern with following aspects: “(1) the social and the psychological origins of (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) dif-
ferential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in (6) need gratification and (7) other
consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones” (Katz etal, 1974b, p. 20). The studies of Katz and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the uses and gratifications approach. Since
then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The current status of uses and
gratifications is still based on Kate’s first analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in
such an electronic information age when people have more options of media use.
