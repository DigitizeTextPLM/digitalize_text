1. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Comumercialization of culture in the United States had
mo Te gone far beyond anything he had seen j
Europe. Further, the prevalence af advertising in the United States was s nek rdntiva

omething with no correlative
in Europe. The closest thing in Adornos experience to the advertising industry in the United States

wis Ffasciat propaganda (Tiger, 104, p. 122), Adorno was later ta allude to hia experience with
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being incdlistinguishable from palitical
propaganda [Horkheimer and Adore, 2002, p. OF. Tk became obvious that Lazarafeld and Adorna did
Hot agree on the vilue of eeupirical studies, and Adorno left the Project, Adornas distatistaction with
the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop
the idea of the culture industry.

Because af the relationship between the Institute for Soctal Research and Cotombia University,
Horkhetmer, mho had already moved to California, cond not trig Adora to the Weat Coast until
November f2j1, When Adorno tas finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate community that
tricluded Frits Long, Arnold Schoenberg, Mang Sister, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Dahlin, ona
Bertolt Brecht, seneral of enbich fownd work in the Hollywood masie industry. The foct that Adorno
tas part of this titeliectual community whose members were involved in the production of Hollywood
matics tiuat hove had same influence in developing Ais thonghts on cullure, aince the Hollywood ayatem
inhibited the creative freedom thot many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany.

These precomditionsAdornos interest in music, bis friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Ftadio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in Callfornla anc the
Telationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important to an understanding of
his concern for the idea of the culture industry,

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radia did not bother to present itself as art, They were instead
a business, amd this in turn became an ideclagy to legitimize the trash they intesthooally produce
(Horkhelmer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This busines: was based on what Adam referred to at Pordist
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hobendashl,
1995, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adomowere the Hollywood production system, of
the CES radio network that had been assoclated with the Princeton Racin Hesearch Project. Mavies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adore,
2002. p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system,
and thar nothing truly adversarial to the syatem would emerge (Horkbeimer and Adorno, 2002, p.
106-7]. Paradoxically, any innovation would only reafiicm the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles
a2 an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity im the system would
allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual
(Friedman, 1981, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
af gocial control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in & system of economic
eoercian ultimately meant the freedom to be the Ad. 202, p. 126).
