The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication

Che influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975),

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of lowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,
one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a sul
stantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication, After graduation, initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but in 145 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
(Samelson, 2000), Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin’s theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging fleld of in-
terpersonal communication and on the development of LRT, Festinger ts best known for the theories
of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted to
explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual, Lewin foreshadowed CDT
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). CDT allows for three
relationships to occur arnong cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equi-
librium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each
other; and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question hawe no effect on one anather
(West & Turner, 2000). Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of arousal and dis-
comfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look te
feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. Te evaluate the self, the individual
usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to the self. This need for sacial comparsson can
result in conformity pressures (Trenholm d& Jensen, 20K). Berger and Calabrese aaa print
