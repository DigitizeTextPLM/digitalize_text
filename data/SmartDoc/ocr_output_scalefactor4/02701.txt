ades” (p. 416), Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus
on dyadic COMMuUNIcation, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as
a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically
focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized
that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).
Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has
contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus
on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work
is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our
understanding of interpersonal processes.

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been jdentified as an important construct, necessary to the study of commiu-
nication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined
and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of in elem
theory. Shannon and Weavet (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed Pe given rap ans : a there
