1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry"

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culture industry outside of a German contest. In the years since there have been numer-
aus cribicianns of the text, not least sauce Adora made sweeping generalzaions about “the
commedified and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cock, 1986. p. 113). Par the
generalty sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adomo erred in nal discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on omer
business sectors, including marketing and advectising (Coom, 1996, p. 4B).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorn and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideciogy, be-
linving that “capitalet society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasnwe refication” (Eagleton,
4841. p. 46). Stl, Eagleton conceded that “the difusion of dominant values and beliels
among oparessed peoples im society has some part bo play in ihe reproduction of the sys
jem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1981. p 46). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adorno s ides
of a culture industry was historically limited. since the society thal developed in the 136i
