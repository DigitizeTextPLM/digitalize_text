Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research, He focused on
conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda
and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswell is credited with creating
the mass. communication procedure of comtent analysis (Rogers, 1994), Generally, content analysis can be
detined as, '"_..the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classifications
in onder 10 Measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994), In an essay entitled "Contents of Communication,”
Laswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's apinian, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the coment of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that mans from control to concent and from content
to audience" (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is thed strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects” (p. a4). Content analysis was easen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area ducing the
remainder of his career. ;

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was alse interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the efferts of the media, Lasswell was particularty
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public oplnion within a democratic system. [n this
way, Lasswell has created 4 cycle, whereby the public is Limited in the information that is presented aes
and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it bs still that information that ts affecting their oes
the democratic system, and is heing presented to them by the government. ‘This is an interesting way
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories.
