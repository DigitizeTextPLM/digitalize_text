i. GENESIS OF “THE CULTURE INDUSTRY"

1 Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

a Poa to Lintseret a the creation of the idea of the culture industry as well as its reception the concept can be
examined chronologically, from its pre-conditions, through its generation, to its subsequent impact. The idea of
bs slog industry grows out of a concem with culture, is developed through insights into the mechanical re=
production of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition net only to popular muse, but also to Holly wend
movies. That this is so grows out ofa number of historical contingencies.

Adomo was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends, Since Benjamin
never sensed a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adomo
became in effect Benjamins only pupil. After Benjamin's death “it was Adorna who then introduced a rational-
ized version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (Jager, 2004, p. 65-4). The relationship with Benjamin had
an. impact on the development of Adormnos thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adomo began
teaching at the Institute. Adomo lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Mazi
party, Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switeerland, and the Institute began
operating there, The Nazis rise to power not only meant that Adorno lost his jot and would everitually force his
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jiingen Habermas would later note, the
fact that labor movernents were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe-
riences influencing the development of critical theary, the others being Stalinist repression and the production

of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 43),

Adomo was at Oxford from 1934 to 1938, where he worked ona manuseript on Husserl. He was considered
an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frank-
furt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the [ete
19305 Adamo evidenced lithe hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
19305, Benjamin and Adore debated mass culture, sino film and radio became the two mast popular means
te disseminate propaganita under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is In effect a pessimistic reply two Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic easay, “The Work af Act in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adorno lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard over the radio, ond could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adomo was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass qusie and the new listening help to make cicape foc the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adorno, XI0Lb, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as te emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adame, the aura of the original artwork was the

essential of the artiste authenticity. Ta Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
quthority of Platonic order from the tep-the original or Idea- ta down of layers of imitations; to Adora, mass
production was nathing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attibude of the Frankfurt schoo!
was that of Adam. In 1938 Max Horkbeimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in
New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, rao by Pool Lazars-
feld, Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although be later claimed that be did not know what a “radbo project” was. For his part,
Lazarsfeld looked forward te working with Adorno, whom he knew te he an expert om music. Adoma
wrote for the Project's Jourial in 1541, reiterating his position that radio was only an. image ofa live pertar-
mance, In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio industry that dhe medium was bringing serious musi
to the matses (Wiggershaus, 1904, p. 243). While working ot the Princeton. Busdic Research Project Adame
became shocked at the depres to which culture had hecoene commercialized in the United States. ;
