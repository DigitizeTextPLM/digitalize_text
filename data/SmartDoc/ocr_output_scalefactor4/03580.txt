1 Other Propaganda Theorists

11 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical ana lises of propaganda. -
fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himse
Ro 1954).
Hoar Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on
conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda,
and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994), Lasswell is credited with creating
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994), Generally, content analysis can be
defined as, °...the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classifications
in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled "Contents of Communication,"
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take inte account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience’s opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence that runs from control to content and from content
to audience” (p, 74).

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Laswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, "Wha says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" (p. 84). Content analysis was essen-
Hally the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the

remainder of bis career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media, Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that {s presented to them,
amd also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still that information that is affecting their decisions within

the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s thearies,

1.2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

AL approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell w
Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, amd public opinion. Bemays (1928)
defines propaganda 45, a CONSistent, enduring effort to create ar shape events to influence the relations of a
public to an enterprise, ides, or Broup (p. 254, Contrary to other propaganda theorlses, Bernays recogni
