1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion,
social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, bal-
ance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005), Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology,
played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider,
Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction,

relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars
as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the decade
and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger became popular
along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson.
Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal comm research
agenda during the past two decades” (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus
on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication #5

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important consou
nication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept orl

theory. Shannon and ‘Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed ina given situation when there
was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probabilicy of their event was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
alen contributed to the developoeent of UT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the
information theorists a5 well as Heider (1956) research in arributian, Berger and Calabrese (1975)

predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way
that they do. Berger and Bradiac"s (19B2) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this
