1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience mem-

bers. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication mes-
sage for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different
individuals. There is not only one way that people uses media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons
for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974),

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and
education, affect people’s ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their
needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications
for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person

interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape fram routine or
problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal
identity: self reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance (farms of infarma-

tion seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based
on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus
‘“nternal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use {Figure 1). Figure 1. A

structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch and Haas
(1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and

put them into five categories:

cquiring information, knowledge and understanding:

1. Cognitive needs, including a

2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;
stability, status,
family and friends; and

3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility,

4, Social integrative needs, ingluding interacting with

5 Tension release needs, including escape and diversian.
