Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-

abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Uincer-
tainty Reduction theary (URT), accredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J, Calabrese (1973), recognized thal
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce unce tainty” (p. 153}. The study of information is basic
to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical

research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the role of communication into the central

focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted em pirical research ee oe
