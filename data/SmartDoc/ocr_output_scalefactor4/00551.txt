1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1872 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culture indusiry ouiside of a German coniesi. In the years since there have been mumer-
aus oriiciens af the tes, vot leet since Adorno made sweeping penernlizaions abaut “the
commodified and fetiahized character of al culbural goods” (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
penerally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adomo erred in not discussing the prooasses of cul-
tural production, ane failed to acamine the culture industry's economic depancence an other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).
For Terry Eagieton, both Adame and Marcuse overestimated the dominant idealogy. be-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasiee reification’ (Eaghton,
1801. p. 48). Sbll, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dommant values and beliefs.
among oppressed peoples im society has some part te play in the reproduction of ihe ays
