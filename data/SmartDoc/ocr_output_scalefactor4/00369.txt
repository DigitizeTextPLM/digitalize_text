105). Functional theory influenced studies on communication fram the 1920s to the 19406, After that, a shift
which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led ta establishment of uses
and gratifications approach

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as
empirical mass cornmunication research itself (MicCuall, 1984}, Dating back to the 1940s, researchers becarne
interested in the reasons for viewing different radia programmes, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well
as daily newspaper (Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949: Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc). In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium
itself (Katz et al., 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice,
Support, or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 114; Warner and Henry, 1948): rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Wises and pratiications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and as 4 communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in 5a
ciology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago unt! 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem, In the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and commu nication from the 1970s tol940s [UPENN, 2001). In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Katz’s mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, whois one of the pioneers of gratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theary model, Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with ale
nation that people use the media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas Ht a subject
which ig known as the uses and gratifications research were explored. They viewed the mass media as a means
by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to
their needs more readily than the media overpower them [Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973). ; ,

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published a collection of Seth gratifi ae ns in 1974 wh oy
were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication. They took a more humanisti cele a yin a wai
