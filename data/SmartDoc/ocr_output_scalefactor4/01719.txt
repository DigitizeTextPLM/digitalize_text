Rogers was bor in Carrall, Lowa im 1931. He eamed his BA. MLA. and Ph.D, degrees from Lowa
State University, Fortwo years during the korean War, he served in the US. Air Force. Interestingly,
in 1964, he worked on some family planning communicalson projects in Korea.

The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theary and it creats applications of diffu-
sion theory in such fields a8 geography, economics, psychology, political sconce, and, a5 previously
mentioesd, communication. Rogers retired from University of Mew Mexico in MM becouse be was
suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005.

According to Rogers (140), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu-
fiewed through certain channels over time among the members ala social system. An [Innovation
is an Wes, peoctice or object perceived a5 new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu.
sien of inmevations involves both mass media ard interpersonal communication channels” (p. 405)
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal COMMmUnication of Mass comme
nicalion people can gel information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) preserved a well-known model of communicaticn that is analyzed as five parts, 5-M4C-R-E
(e.g. sender-misiage-chonnel-receiver-effect!. Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this 5-M-C-R-E come|nu-
nication model comespords closely to the elements of diffusion” (p 19. Specifically, (1) sender
can be lrventocs of opinion lenders, (2) message can be & new idea of product, (3) channels can be

interpersonal of mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adopeion of social change. In the diffizsion theory, ‘Time’ variable
isa very important factor. According 10 Rogers (1495), time variable is involved in diffizsion in (1)
the imowntiondecision process; (2) innowaliveness: (3) an innovetion’s rate of adoption. Mest inmo-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. [yyfiasiom research Mas alfempurd to explain the varibles
