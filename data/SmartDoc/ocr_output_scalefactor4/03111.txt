Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural linguistics,
To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation
by speaking actors. The former is called langue aind the latter parole. Langue is the systematized sat
of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which compose
it; a8 Oppesed to it, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language" (Barthes, 1267,
f.13). Barthes interprets Sauseures linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level,
langue, is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized,
On the contrary, parole is flexible because itis the actual expression at the individual level. However,

itis considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot! be free from the
Shared convention, the structure,

4 language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. tis the social part of
language, iis essentially a collective contract which one must accept in is entirety if one
wishes to communicate. it is because a language ls a system of contractual values that if
resists the modificabens coming fram a single individual and le consequently a social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is beacause speech is
essentially a combinative activity that if coresponds to and individual act and not to a pure
creation, (Barthes, 167, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system inte two parts, the
signified and the signifier, The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the tenm.
The form is called the signifier, which is the extemal part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "| propose to retain the word sign (signe) fo
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (eignifie) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage ef indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them fram each other and from the whole of which they are parts” (Saussure, 1958, in R. Innis
(ed,}, p. 37). The correspondence of the conceptimeaning to the extemal fonm is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable intemal relation but the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying syslem. Saussure (1960) argues that language does.
not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from
within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences". According to Saussure, "meaning
is produced through a process of selection and eambination of signs along two axes, the eyntagmatic
e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g., synonyms). organized into a signifying system” (Barker,
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
mati¢ comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means 4 field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Its consider the follow
ing sentence: "I went to a theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence ip established through the
linear combanation of signs. The signs within the example, such 2s | theater, my, and girlfriend can be

Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated par
