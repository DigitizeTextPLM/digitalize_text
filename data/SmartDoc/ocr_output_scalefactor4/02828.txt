Hacker Foundation. with the involvement of George Gerbuer and others. In this essay Adorno
warned, rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed
of Peycholopical control (Adora, 01a. BP 160). Tt was one of the few occasions in the 1950s
that Adomo would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments
of the fifties (Jager, 2004, B 181). Adomo would nonetheless on oreeasion attempt to reshape
his thought on the culture industry. For ¢ Mamiple, in 1969 he wrote of a universal petudo-culture
in the United States (Adore, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the essay ‘Transparencies on Film,
Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to

the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 131),

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to
other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society |Feeitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satished and quiescent [Alway, 1995, p. 83). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were toa
maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.

Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions
(Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, it is difficult in Marcuses argument to separate culture
or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass

media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno

had done. In the end Marcuses analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant
ideology, Marcuse wrote, "how can the administered individualswho have made their mutilation
inte their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged scaleliberate
themselves from themselves as well as from their masters’ How is it even thinkable that the

vicious circle be broken? (Marcuse, 1991, p. 251). Given the pessimistic tone of th i

it is somewhat ironic that largely because of it he would be perceived as an icon for leftist

movements of the 1960s in the U.5. and Germany that develope:
\farcuse maintained that he was a philosopher, and not an activist. Like others
“a that theory could be translated

1 an oppositional stance

In spite of this, hh
associated with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of the ide
into practice (Chambers, 2004, p. 226}.
