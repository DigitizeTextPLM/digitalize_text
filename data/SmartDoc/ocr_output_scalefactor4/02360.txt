1, NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

) Five basic asumptions were stated ina study of Katz, Blumer, and Garevitch in 15974 a5 follows.
) They provide 4 framework for understanding the corelation berween media and audiences;

1. The auxlience is conceived a5 active, 1.e,, an important part of of mass media use is
acsumed to be goal ociemted ... patterns of media use are shaped by more or less
definite expectations of what certain kinds of coment have to offer the audience
Temi ber.

2. In the cass Communication process much initiative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limétation on

theorizing soul any form ef straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and
behavior.

3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
Tass COMMUnICaton constinne bur a segment of the wider range of baman needs,
ace] the degree to which they can be adequately met ihrough mass media consumip-
on cestaimly varics.

4. Methedlolegically speaking, many of the goals of mass media ose can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- ie, people |
are sufficiently self-aware to ber able to repert their imterests and motives im
Partiqular cases, or at beast to recogmize them when confrented with them im an |
intelligible and Eamiliar verbal fornmulation.

5. Value jadgments about the culboral significance of mass communication should be
# suspended while audience onentatioes are explored on their own perms. (jp. 15-17). |

In addition, Kare, Blomler, and Gurevitch alsa commenced that, although pervious researches on
pratificabons detected diverse pratifications that attract people on the media. they did mot address the |
comiections berwern these grathficanions (Kar et al., 1974a). They saggested thar uses and gratifi-
calons pesearch concerns with following aspects: “C1 the sochal and the paycholegical origins of (2)
neods which generate (2) expectaions of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead oo (5) dif
ferenrial exposure (or engaging in other activities), cewalting in (h) need gratification and (7) ober
roMmequences, perhaps mostly unintended anes” (Kace otal, 74, p 20). The srucies of Rare and
bos collesgaes laid a theoretical fealation of beaikling the uses and gratification appenach, Since
then, the research on this subject hes been strengthened and extended, The current status of goes and
gracifications is still based om Kate's first analysis, particularly a new nedia forms have emerged in |
aoch an electronic informathm age when people have maoer options of mreedia awe,

1) Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifecetions approach emphasines motives and the sell-perceived needs of audience mem-
bers. Euender and Face (1974) conchoded that different people can use the same COmmuniceticn eees-
sage for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different
fedividuals, There ie mot only one way thal people ius eed Contrarily, (here are as many reason
for owing the media as there are media users (Blumer Be Katz, 15744.
