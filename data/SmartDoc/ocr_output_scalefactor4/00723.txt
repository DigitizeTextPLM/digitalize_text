1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience mem-
bers. Blumler alle Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication mes-
sage es very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different
individuals. There Is nat only one way that people uses media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons
for using the media as there are media users {Blurnler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and
education, affect people's ideas about what they want fram media and which media best meet their
needs, That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications
for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) propesed a model of “media-persan
interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape fram routine or
problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal
identity: self reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance tforms of informa-
tion seeking).

Another subdivided version ofthe audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (2974), based
on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” WETsus “passive” Initiation, “external” Wersus
“nternal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types af motivations which apply to media ust (Figure 1), Figure 1. A

structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (MeGauire, 1974). Katz, Gureviteh and bi
(1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychelagical functions ofthe mass media an
put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acauiring information, knowledge and understanding:
9. Affective needs, inchoding emotion, pleasure, feelings;

3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stabiity, Stetus;

4. Social integrate nee, jneluding interacting with fanny and friends: and

5, Tension release needs, including e3¢ape and diversion.
