the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content ana yals se e
defined as, "the investigation of communication messages by categorizing mestage content into tlosalfications
in order ta measure certain variables" (Ropers, 1994). In an essay entitled "Contents of Conmminkcalien,
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's apinion, and
the invensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that runs fram contre) to content and from content
to aadience’ (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is thed strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects* (p. 64). Content analysis was essen

remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how poopaganda could
shape public opinion, ‘This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of che media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still that information that is affecting their decisions within

the democratic eystem, and is being presenced co chem by the government, This isan interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theorles.

12 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

Al approximately the same time that Lippmann and Laswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, prepaganda, and public opinion, Bernays (192)
defines propaganda 53, 4 consistent, enduring effort to creat or shape events to influence the relations of a
public to an enterprise, idea, or group (p, 25). Contrary ta other propaganda theorist, Bemays recognises
that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public. [t can help individuals decide what to think

Bemays states, “We are governed, our minds are molded, aur tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely sc
men we have never heard of. Vast numbers of furan beings must cooperate in this manner if They are to lve
together as a smoothly functioning society (p. 4).
Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be modified, and that such shaping j
