I, DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion,
social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, bal-
ance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology,
played 4 considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider,
Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research imerests began 16 shift into the realm of social interaction,
Telational development, and relational comtrol. This was influenced by the research of such scholars
as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, amd Thihaut. Charing the later part of the decade
and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Raloff, and Berger became popular
along. with research ino behavioral and communicative adapaation by Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson.
Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal comm research
agenda during the past two decades" (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus
on dyadic communication, comounicaben invelving face-to-face interaction, or communication as

a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically
focuses on the developenent, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. In has been recognized
