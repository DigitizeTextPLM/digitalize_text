1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of lowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,
one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a sub-
stantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication, After graduation, initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts [nsti-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
(Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger's research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging field of in-
terpersonal communication and on the development of URT, Festinger 1s best own for the theor' "8
of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theary (CDT) attempted to
eX plain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadow ed C DT
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982), ¢ DT allows for three
relationships to occur among comnithons: a consonant relat onship, if which cognitions = in a
librium with each other; a dissonant relationship, im which cognitions are in competition W i oo
