The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creats applications of diffu-
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously
mentioned, communication, Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was
suffering from kidney disease, He died on October 21, 2005.

According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu-
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-

sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).

That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu-

nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as use ful. Lasswell

(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-C-R-E

(e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect}, Rogers (1993) mentioned, “this S-M-C-R-E commu-

nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p, 19). Specifically, (1) sender

can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variable
is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)

the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables

that influence how and why users and audience adopt anew information medium, such as the Internet.

According to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are importanteven though in the

past the individual is usually the unit of analysis, Also, critical mass becomes an important Jacter in

ive tools and thus are required by many users to

adopting new media because new media are interact users
gain efficiency, That is, the more people use, the more people get henefits, Jn this sense, diffusion

theory not only can apply to practical things, but also can be related to digital divide,

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
“(1) Innovators (venturesome)}, (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Lagwards (traditional)” (Rogers, | 995, PP. 183-185), Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40), Figure | shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories
follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped, Source by www2.gsu.edu"wwwittidocs/dif-

a S-shaped curve. However, a5 noted above, different types of innavations fe.g., the rate of tetracycline

adoption is faster than that of the hybrid seed corm) can have their own different rates in diffusion. Fig-

there are five stages.
