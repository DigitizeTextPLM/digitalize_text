1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adome, popular culture on film and radio did not bother ta present itself as art. They were instead
4 busines, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intenthonally produce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred ta as Fordist
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl,
1995, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adormowere the Hollywood production system, or
the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Hadio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, aod the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
S002, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the eyetem would emerge [Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p.
106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reatiinm the system, and Adamo cited Oreon Welles
a2 an example of semeone who was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would
allow it to assume the etance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual
{Friedman, 1981, p. 166). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
rl control [Horkheimer and Adora, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of economic
to be the same (Horkheime 2, p. 136).

Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry [Hotkheimer and
Adorne, 2002, p. 101). It was not high art that Adorno was presenting a: an alternative to the culture
industry, but modernism. Although he provides the idea of an opposing force to the culture industry,
Adorno provides no overt Marxist analysis, Instead, he notes in passing that the dominant system
utilized capacities for mass consumption for entertainment or amusement,
Since Adorno had been, in his essays on music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, The
Culture Industry has been criticized as belng a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture.
Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and

Adorno, 2002, p. 101).
