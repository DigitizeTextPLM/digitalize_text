Uses and Gratifications

1.1. Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential i
conception of the approach was based on the st dees far NAR gue oneeect
certain media contents, The Core question of such reasearch is: Why do people use media
and what do they use them for? (McQuall, 1983), There exists a basic idea in this approach:
audience members know media content, and which media they can use to mest thelr needs.
In the mass communication process, uses and gratifications approach puts the function of
linking need gratifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience rnembers. It
Suggests that people's needs influence what media they would choose, how they use cer-
tain media and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs from other
theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users as opposed to
passive receivers of information. In cantrast to traditional media effects theares which focus
on “what media do to people” and assume audiences are homogeneous, uses and gratifica-
tions approach is mare concerned with “what peaple do with media’ (Katz, 1959). It allows
audiences personal needs to use media and responds to the media, which determined by
their social and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates
that the media compete with other information sources for audience's need satisfaction (Katz
et al., 1974a)}. As traditional mass media and new media continue to provide people with a
wide range of media platforms and content, it is considered one of the most appropriate
perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be exposed to different.
The approach emphasizes audiences’ choice by assessing their reasons for using
a certain media to the disregard of others, as well as the various gratifications obtained
from the media, based on individual social and psychological requirements (Severin
& Tankard, 1997). As a broader perspective among communication researches, it pro-
vides a framework for understanding the processes by which media participants seek
information or content selectively, commensura te with their neads aaa ete ee
of al,, 1974a). Audience members then incorporate the content to fu oi

to satisfy their interests (Lowery & Nabila, 1983).
