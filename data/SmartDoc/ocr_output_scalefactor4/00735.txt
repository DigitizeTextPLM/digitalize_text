needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications
ror using different media, McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person
interactions’ to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape fromm routine or
problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship: social utility: (3) Persona
identity: self reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance {forms of informa-
hon seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based
on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus
“internal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1.

(1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding;
9. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, tee ings:

3, Personal integrative reeds, including credibility, stability, status;

4. Social integrative needs, including interac ting with fomily and friends, ana

5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.
