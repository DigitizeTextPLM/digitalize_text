I. GENESIS OF “THE CULTURE INDUSTRY"

1 Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

in order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry as well as its reception the concept can be
examined chronologically, from its pre-condition, through its generation, to its subsequent impact. The idea of
the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, is developed through insights into the mechanical re-

production of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music, but alsa to Hollywood
movies. That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies.

Adormo was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin
never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno
became in effect Benjamins only pupil. After Benjamin's death “it was Adorno who then introduced a rational-
iged version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (Jager, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had

an impact on the development of Adomos thought during this peried. Retuming to Frankfurt, Adom began
teaching, at the Institute. Adome lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi
party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began
operating ther. The Paazis rise to power mot only feant that Adamo lost his job and would eventually force his
departure from Germany, hut also affected his philosophical thought. As Jirgen Habermas would Later nate, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe
riences influencing the development of eritical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production

Adomo was at Cnford from 1934 to 1938, where he worked on a MMLC pee ot Husserl. He was considered
an outsider, never integrating inio the British academic mainstream. and he looked forward to joining his Frank-
