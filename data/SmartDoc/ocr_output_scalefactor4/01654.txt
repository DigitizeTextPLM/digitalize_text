I. OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1 Other Propaganda Theorists
1.1) Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propapanda. In
fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself
(Rogers, 1994),

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on
conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the concent of propaganda,
and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswell is credited with creating
the mass comovunication procedure of content analysis (Ragers, 124). Generally, convent analysis can be
defined as, "...the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classifications
in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled “Contents of Communicarion,*
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, And
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasawell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that runs fram control to content and from conbent
to audience” (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is led stronaly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, "Who say what in which channel to whom and with what effects” (p. 44). Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a bot of work within this area curing the
remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of prapaganda, Lasswell was also inverested in haw propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understancling the effects of he media. Lesswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limbted in the information that és presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is scill that information that is affecting their decisions within

the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing
the pewer of the media thar bs somewhat similar ta Lippmiann’s theories,

1.2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

Ad approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bermays (1691°1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bemays (1928)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations ol FE
public to an enterprise, idea, or Group (p- 25). Contrany to other propaganda theorists, Bernays recognizes
that propaganda can be either beneficial or larmful te the public. tt can help irkdivicuals decide what to think
ahout or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial ta society's funcening as 4 whole.
Bermays states, “We are governed, our minds aie molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by
men we have never beard of... Vast numbers af human beings must cooperate in this manner if they ane to Live
