1.1.) Introduction

| Waes and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media research. The onginal
| conception of the approach was based on the nesearch for explaining the great appeal of
certain media contents. The core question of such research ie: Why do people use media
and whatdo they wee them for? (McQuail, 1963). There exists a basic idea in this approach:
audience members know media content, and which media they can use io meet thei needs
in fhe mass communicalion process, uses and gratifications approach puts the function of
linking need pratifications and media choice clearly on the dide of audiance members. It
suggesis Ihal people's needs influence whal media they would chaces, how they use Ger |
lain media and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differe trom other
jheoreical perspectives in thal @ regards audiences as active media users a6 opposed ta
| passive reocivers of information. In contrast to traditional media effects theanes which focus I
on “whal media do to progie” and assume audiences are hamopencous, uses and graheaca- :
tions appreach is more concemed with “what people do with media’ (Matz, 1359). [f allows
audiences personal needs to use media and responds to the media, which determined by
their social and psychological background. Uses and gratificalions approach also postulates
