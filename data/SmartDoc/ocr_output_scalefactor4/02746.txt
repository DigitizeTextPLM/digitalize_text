1. CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generabing propaganda in influencing
public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself made @ statement regarding his phrase,
the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning, And it is careful planning more
than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity anid
propaganda {Hernays, 1955, p22). Furthermore, Hernays theories also represent 4 different view of
the formation of public opinion, In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public i not an amorphous mass which
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) affers the idea
that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can bet
mate amicable and rutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can woderstand anc is willing ta wecept ip. 66).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a toal that can be
used to combine the ideas af the public and the persuader, The abjective-minded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bermays,
1952, p. 4). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public i pesalble. Ternays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,

to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, ta evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade ar suggest courses of action (p. 10}. Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, tt is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists ouch a
Lippmann and Ellul tendecl to cisagree with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Gippmann, Dasswell, Elid, and Bernaye are tmportant for a timer of
tasone. Based on the ideas of his predeceasore, Lippmann sas able fo bring attention to the fact that
the public ig ohte to be influenced by the media. The work of Lippmonn and his collengues hes fed to more
recent research thet is meand fo helo understand the influence of the media on the public. Through the
work Fyengor ond Kinder, White, Lewin, and MeCombs and Shaw, amore comprehension: understanding
of the media hos been developed, The public hag now deen made aware varios media functions suck ox

their oudiences.

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the ditect effects and limited eHects
media models, Theorists such as Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
propaganda could directly influence the thought of the mases. Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippmann
also noted that the media might not be Influencing only thought, but may also be Influencing what
people thought about. Tt was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting point for future research
in the area of the limited effects af the media, Such limited effects were shown through the work of
lyexgar and Kinder, as well as MeCombe and Shaw, Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in
this paper bas been very important to the understanding of the media, the manipulation of the public,
and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Laszwell, Bernays, and Ellul
were formed years ago, they continue to help us understand the society that surrounds us today.
