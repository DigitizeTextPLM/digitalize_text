1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

Foe Adore, pop culture on film and radio did not bethee bo preent itself as art. They were instead

a business, and this in turn became am keokgy to legitimie the teh they intentionally produce
[Horkbeimer and Adorno, HWE p. 3 1. This business was based om what Adore referred to at Forde

the caltural epbere, insofar ss 1 tendencies were based on ceniralt and hierarchy (Aobendahl.

Since Adorne had been, in his cseaye on music and cedio, an apparent defender of high art, The
Culture Industry has bees criticived as being & defense of high art, opposed to popular culoure,
Adorno epecifically defines mwnt-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Herikkeimer and
Adorno, 202, p. 1L).
