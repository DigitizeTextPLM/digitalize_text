1 Other Propaganda Theorists

11) Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

‘grea was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In
a, the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself
(Rogers, 1994).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on
conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda,
and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswell is credited with creating
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis can be
defined as, ”...the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classifications
in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994]. In an essay entitled “Convents of Communication,”
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try te persuade the audience's opinion, and

the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims. to
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that puns from contrel to content and from content
to audience" (p. 743.

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, “Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" (p. 64). Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went an to do a Int of work within this area during the
remainder of his career,

Aside from unserstanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects ofthe media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within 4 democratic system. In this:
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprebensive to accept it. However, {tis still that infermatbon chat is affecting their decesiors within
the democratic system, and is being, presented to them by the gowernment. This is an interesting way of viewing
the pawer of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann's theories.

1.2 Edward Bernays (1991-1995)
AL approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,

Edward Bernays (1841-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, ard public opinion. Bemays (1928)

defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effort ta create or shape events to influence the relacions af a

rise, idea, ar group (p. 25). Contrary ta other propaganda theorists, Bennays recognizes

public to an enterp 2
that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public. It cam help individuals decide what to think

ralter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to society's functioning asa whole.

i States, ie are governed, aur minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, larwely by

men we have never heard af... Wael sumbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live

a smoothly functioning society (p- 3).

ee on cae ideas that the public opinion can be modified, and that such shaping is 4 mecessary part of

society, Hemays pairsued bis work in the field of public relations. *Public relations és the amempt, by information,

anion, and adjustment, to engineer public support for an activity, cause, movement, arinstixucen (Bernays,

1955, p. 2). in the Engineering of Carsent, Bernaps (1855) bays out the framework for understanding the public
