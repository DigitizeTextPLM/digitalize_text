an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward te joining hts Frank=
furt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the late
1930s Adome evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adomo debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular Mears
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Artin the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adorno lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, sym phonic works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adome was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adome, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adonvo, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea- to down of layers of imitations; to Adorno, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adorno, In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in
New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, run by Paul Lazars-
feld. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although he later claimed that he did not know what a “radio project" was. For his part,
Lazarsfeld looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be an expert on music. Adorno
wrote for the Project's journal in 1941, reiterating his position that radio was only an image of a live aie
mance. In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio industry that the medium was bringing serious music
to the masses (Wiggershaus, 1994, p, 243). While working at the Princeton Radio Research Project A
became shocked at the degree to which culture had become commercialized in the United States. domo

Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin

an impact on the development of Adonos thought during this period, Returning to Francta Pee
