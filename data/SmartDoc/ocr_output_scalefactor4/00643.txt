A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. It is the social bg of
language, itis essentially a collective cantract which one must accept in its entirety | one
wishes to communicate. Itis because a language is a system of contractual values that it
rasists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social instt-
jution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his persanal thought. It is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual act and notte a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the
signified and the signifier, The signified is a concept or meaning which is ex pressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the extemal forms expressing the actual animal dog, Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis
fed}, p. 37). The correspondence of the concept'meaning to the external farm is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is mot the inevitable internal relation but the difference
behween the signs that Operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that “language does
not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning fram
within itself through a senes of conceptual and phonic diffarences", According ta Saussure, "meaning
is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic
(2.9. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.9., synonyms), organized into a signifying system" (Barker,
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
mathe comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the follow-
ing sentence: “I went to a theater with my girlfriend." This sentence is ast bileh
