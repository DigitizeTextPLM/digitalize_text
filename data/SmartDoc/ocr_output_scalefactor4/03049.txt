The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as
empirical mass communication research itself (MeChuail, 1983), Dating back to the 19405, researchers became
interested In the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such a4 4oap operas and quizzes, as well
a5 daily newspaper (Lazrsteld & Stanton, 1944, 1949: Herzog, 1944; Warmer & Henry, 1948; etc). In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specitic content or by the medium
iteelf [Katz et al, 1974b). For instance, radia soap operas were found to satay their listeners with advice,
Support, or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sence of pecurity, shared topics
of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1945). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”
Lises and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s tll 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the mast well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach,
Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and a5 a communication researcher, He recelwed his PhD. in So-
ciology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Gavernment of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent actedemic wark about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication fram the 1970s tol990s (UPENA, 2000). In
1982, he joined the facuty ofthe Annenberg Schoo! st the University of Fennoyhani and also directed its
