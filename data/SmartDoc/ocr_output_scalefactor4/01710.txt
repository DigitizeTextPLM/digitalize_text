1, NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic assumnphions were sated ina study of Katz, Blumer, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows.
) They provide a framework for uederstanding the cocelation between media and aadiences:

1. The audience is conceived as active, i.e., an important part of ef ones media ose is
assumed to be goal oriented ... pattems of media ase are shaped by more or less
definke expectations of what certain kinds of content hawe to offer the audience
mnember,

2. Inthe mass communication process much initiative in linking meed gratification and
media choice lies with the wedience member. This places a strong limitation on
theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media compent om attinodes and
behavioc.

A. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
Tass COOIMUnECaTion Condlifule bul a segment of the wicker range of human meeds,
and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media comaamnp-
Hon certainly varies.

4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data sapplied by individwal audience members themselves- ie, peaple
are sufficiently self-aware to be able co report their ineerests and mothers im
particular cases, or at beast bo recognize them when combronted with them im an
intelligible ane Lamiliar verbal formulation.

&. Value padements about the culbaral significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience orientations are explored on their crm tenms, (p 15-17)

o In addition, Katz. Blumer, and Garevitch aso commented thal, altoagh previous researches on
Gratification: deteced diverse gratificatiors thar atmact people on che media, they did net address the
connections between these gratifications (Katz et al., 19743). They suggested that uses and grarifi-
canons research concer with follerwing aspects: “(1) he social and the psychological origins of (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which Jead to (5) dif-
ferential exposure for engaging in other activities), rewalting in (6) need gratificarian and (7) ocher
comeequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones" (Kate etal. 297db, p. 20). The studies of Kate and :
his calleagues lald a theoretical foundation of buthding the ses and gratification approach. Since eas
then, the research on this subject has beer sorengihened and exsenmded. The current status of uses and 7
gratificathors is soll based om Katz's first analysis, particularly 45 new media forms have emerged in
such an electric informacion age when people have more options of media use.

1 Needs and Gratifications

ses andl grarifkcations approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience mem-
bers. Blumer arel Kate (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication mes-
sage for very differen! purposes. The same media coment may gratify differem needs for different
lalivideals, There is not only one way that people aves modia, Contrarily, Chere are as many reas
