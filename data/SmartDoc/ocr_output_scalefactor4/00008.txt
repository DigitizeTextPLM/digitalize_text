Played a considerable tole in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider,
Kelley, and Hovland, By the 1970s, research inierests began to shift iio che realm of social imeraction,
relational development, and relational comercd. This was influenced by the research of such scholars
46 Keapp, Mebrabian, Altman, Tayler, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the decade
af] into the 1960s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Raloff, and Berger became popular
along with research into behavioral ated communicative adaptation by Giles, Bungoon, and Paterson.
Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal comm research
agenda daring the past two decades” (p. 46). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus
on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as
a function of developing relationships. Aesearch inn interpersonal communication iheary typically

Since 83 ietroduction in the 196, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that bas

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since ancenaincy has been idescified as an important comsmnact, necessary to the snudy of comenu-
micabon, it would be beneficial to ow when the concept onginated, amd how it has been defined
afi epodied, One way to condider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
thearr, Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed ina given singarion wher Chere
was a high amount of possible aliermatives amd the probability of their event was relatively equal
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
also contributed to the development of WRT, Berger and Calaheese (1975) adiopoed concepts from the
information theorists as well as Heider (159) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded ihe concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining wmcemainty as
the “number of alternative ways in which @ach interactaes might behave” (jp, 100). The gremer the
Jevel of umcemainty chat exists ina situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to pre-
dict behaviors and ocoarences. During interactions indivichoals are not only faced wath problems of
predicting present and past behaviors, bur also explaining why parcners behave or believe in ihe way
that they do. Berger and Bradac’s (1902) definition of uncertainty baghlighted the complexity of this
process when they swated: “Uncertainty, then, cam stem from the lange mamber of ahemative things
that a stranger can bel or potentially say" Lincermalmy plays a slgeiticant role when examining
