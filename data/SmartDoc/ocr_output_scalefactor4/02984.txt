THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in
Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative
in Europe. The closest thing in Adornos experience to the advertising industry in the United States
was fascist propaganda (Jager, 2004, p. 122), Adorno was later to allude to his experience with
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda {Horkheimer and Adorno. 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did
not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adornos dissatisfaction with
the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop
the idea of the culture industry.

Beoouse of the relationship between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University
Horbheimer, who hod already moved to California, could nof bring Adorno to the West Coast until
Notentber P47. When Adorno was finally able to refocate, fe joined an erpatriate community Hat
included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Eisler, Thomes and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Déiin, ana
Bertolt Brecht, several of uhich found inerk in the Holliaeood mouwe mousiry. The fact that Adorno
was port of this intellectual communtiy whose menihers were in 1 dhe production of Holipwood
momes must hove hod some influence in developing Ais Hhoughis on cutture, since fhe Hollyunad system
inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany

These preconditionsAdornos interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the
relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important to an understanding al
hie concern for the idea of the culture industry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
{Horkheimer and Aderno, 2002, p. $5}. This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques wed by Henry Pord were implemented in
the cultural eplhere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendah,
1995, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adornowere the Holhpwood production aystem, of
the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Hadio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work [Horkheimer and Adorno,
2002, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge |Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p.
106-7). Paradexically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, and Adore cited Orson Welles
ag an example of someone whe was allowed to break the rules. Uhe elasticity in the sysbem would
allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make if its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual
