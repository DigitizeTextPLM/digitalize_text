4 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first reall appearance of the Kea of Ihe

culture industry cuiside of a ‘German context In ihe years since there have been nunrear-

qua critiaanns of the text, nol least since Adamo made sweeping generalizations about ‘the

commodified and fetishized character of all cumural gooda” (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the

genetally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Ademe erred in nat discussing the processes of cule

tural production, and failed to examine the culture indushy's economic dependence an other
i arketing and advertaing (Cook, 1508, p. 44).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adamo and Marcuse cverestinated the daminant ideology, be-
leving that “capitalist sccety langquehes in the grip ofan al-penvasnne reiication” (Eaghton,
4901, p. 46). Stil, Eagleton conceded that “the difusion of dominant values are behets
among oppretsed peoples in socely has some part to play in the reproduction of the sy8-
jem as a whole” (Eagleion, 1997. p 38). Frednc Jameson pointed cut tat Adomo's idea
cf a cuiure indugiry was historically limited, since the society thal developed in the 12505
and 1870s wilh rw media went beyond the cultural possiblities available during the 1E40s.
VWehile ihe dea of ihe culture indugiry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial BOGi-
shes between 1920 and 1970, trying bo use it today weakens its efectivencss (Hohendahl,
4ao5, p 146-48). Thus, for a some onics, tne value of the dea of the culture industry would

Thus for some critics modernist works would be counieracting foroes against ihe dominant
eclogy. Ap noted in the example of Orson Velles, however, it may be the case that the
dominant deoslogy can co-opt modernist works for is own ends. The idee of the culture
industry hae had an importance in critical iheory since its appearance in the 1940s, in that
it has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation to ideology, are
