1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

4972 Enalish-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of he

ous criticisms of the text, not least since Adema made sweeping generalizations aut jhe
commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1996, p. 413). For :
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adormo erred in nat discussing the processes of cu
tural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's ecanomic dependence on oiher
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adomo and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, be-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification (Eagleton,
1991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the sy5-
tem ag a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 38). Fredric Jameson painted out that Adorno’s dea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the 1960s
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 19406.
While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial saci-
eties between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl,
7995, p. 146-48). Thus, fora some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry would
appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value at all.

Thus for seme critics modernist works would be counteracting forces against the dominant
ideology. 4 noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case that the
dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of the culture
industry has had an importance in critical theory since its appearance in the 1940s, in that
it has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation to ideology, and
hence, society. Since Adora made sweeping generalizations about the impact of the culture
industry, and since he did net systematically explore how the culture industry operated, it has
been generally easy for some to dismiss the idea of a culture industry. It is nonetheless the
case that motion pictures are still made by large companies and that their movies largely rely
an formulaic plots. lt is also the case that radio is increasingly controlled by a small number
of companies, which tend to impose restrictions on how siations operate. As a broadcast
medium, television is very much related to both radio and film, and shares with them qualities
that situation it in the culture industry. While thera is a democratizing aspect to the Internet
(in that anyone can create a web site), it happens that the commercial companies operating
on the Internet continue to maintain an ideological function. Far example, one seldom sees

new stories on MSNBC or Yahoo that would question the prerogatives of corporate Ameri
