Uses and Gratifications

1.1. Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media research. The original
conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of
certain media contents. The core question of such research is: Why do people use media
and what da they use them for? (McQuail, 1983), There exists a basic idea in this approach:
audience members know media content, and which media they can use ta meet their needs.
In the mass Communication process, uses and gratifications approach puts the function of
linking need gratifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience mambers. It
suggests that people's needs influence what media they would choose, how thay Use oer
tain media and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs from other
theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users as apposed to
passive receivers of information. In contrast to traditional media effects theories which focus
on “what media de to people” and assume audiences are hornegeneous, uses and gratifica-
tions approach is more concerned with “what people do with media” (Katz, 1959), It allows
audiences personal needs to use media and responds to the media, which determined by
their social and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates
that the media compete with other information sources for audience's need satisfaction (Kate
et al., 1974a). As traditional mass media and new media continue to provide people with a
wide range of media platforms and content, it is considered one of the most appropriate
perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be exposed to different. |
The approach emphasizes audiences’ choice by assessing their reasons for using ; ie
a certain media to the disregard of others, as well as the various gratifications obtained q
from the media, based on individual social and psychological requirements (Severin
& Tankard, 1997). As a broader perspective among communication researches, it pro- i
vides a framework for understanding the processes by which media participants seek ; F
information or content selectively, commensurate with their needs and interests (Katz
et al, 1974a). Audience members then incorporate the content to fulfill their needs or
to satisty their interests (Lowery & Nabila, 1984).

4.2 Origin and History
It ig well accepted that communication theories have developed through the realms of psy-

hology and sociology over the past 100 years. With illumed by valuable ideas as well a8

conceptions of understanding media.
