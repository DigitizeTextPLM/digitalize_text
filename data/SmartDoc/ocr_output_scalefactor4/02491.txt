in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). CDT allows for three

(West & Turner, 2000), Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of arousal and dis-
comfort that individuals seck to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to
feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual
usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to the self. This need for social comparison can
result in conformity pressures (Trenholm && Jensen, 2004). Berger and Calabrese (1975) related so-
cial comparison to URT by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons seek out similar others
who are proximate when they experience a hich level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of
their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation” (p. 107), Festinger received the Distinguished
Scientist award of the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Senior Scientist
Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger’s legacy is significant, and
his theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research. Aronson (in
Festinger, 1980) stated, “It was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of
cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, social psychology has not been the same since” (p. 3)-
