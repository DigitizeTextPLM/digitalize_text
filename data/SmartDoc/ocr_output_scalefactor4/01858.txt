19305 Adomo evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adero debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most papular oveans
te disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “On the Fetish
Ly Se J
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in etfect a p sssimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “lhe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reprodu ction” (Brunkhorst, 179, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adorno lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall. sy mphonic works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records, The result was inferior to the
original, and Adoma wits emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adorno, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes fied to class, to Adome, the aura of the See wis rs
