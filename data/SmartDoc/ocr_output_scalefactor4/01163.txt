1. OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1 Other Propaganda Theorists

1.1 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In
fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself
(Rogers, 954).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on
condueting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda,
and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswell is credited with creating
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 194). Generally, content analysis can be
defined as, "...the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classifications
an order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled “Contents of Communication,”
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear ina message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Laswell (1546) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence that runs from control to content and from content
to audience” (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is tied strangly to Lasswell (195.3) early definition of communication which
stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects” (p. 84). Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to doa lot of work within this area during the
remainder of his career

Aside from understanding the cantent of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
imerested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way,

Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the infarmation that is presented to them,
and alsa apprebensive to accept i. However,

it is still chat information that i affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and bs being presemed to them by the government. This Is an interesting way of viewing

the power of the media that is somewhat similar co Lippmann’s thearies.

L2 Edward Bernays (1891-195)

At approximately the same time thet Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion amd propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1091-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays (1928)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effort co create or shape evens to influence the relations af a
public to an enterprise, idea, or group (p. 25). Contrary to otber propaganda theorists, Bermays recognizes
that propaganda cam be either beneticial oe harmful eo the public. 1¢ can help individuals decade what to think
about or aloer the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to society's functioning 4% a whole.
Geermnays states, “We are governed, our mires are molded, cur tastes formed, cur ideas suggested, lamgely by
men we hove never beard of... Vast oumbers of bomen beings must cooperate in this manner Uf they are oo live
together as 4 emoothly functioning sockery (p. 3).

Based on these #leas thar the poblic opinion car be modified, and that such shaping if a necessary pant of
society, Bemays pursued his week in che field of public relations, “Public relations ts the anempt, by informacion,
persuasion, and adjuaiment, to engineer pulbe suppor for an activity, cause, movement, or instibution” (Bemays,
1455, p. 2) Inthe Engineering of Consent, Bernas (1955) loys our rhe framework for understanding the public
and developing a piblic relations ewnpaign. Bermays (1955) claims that the key to 4 soocessful public relations
campaign is adjustment of the campaign tothe attinedes of various groups in society, gathering information
bo effecively express an idea, are finally, utilizing, persuasbon to influence che public opinion in che intended
direction.

Bernays’ theories represen a step forward for mass communication theory. They move away free mare
