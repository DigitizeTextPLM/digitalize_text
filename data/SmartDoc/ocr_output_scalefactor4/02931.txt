Uncertainty Reduction

Ll Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theary. Information exchange is a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty, G'mcer-
tainty Reduction theory (URT), accredited to Charles R. Bergerand Richard J, Calabrese (1975), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a ceniral motive of communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertamty” (p. 133). The study of information is basic
ta all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field af interpersonal communication. URT places the role af communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
shrese (1973) nate: “When communication researchers howe conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to cmploy social psychological theories as starting points’ fp. 9),
The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of inter-
personal communication research; with the development of URT, communication researchers began to look to

SOMmunication for theorics of preater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social
BCHSTICES.

Traditionally, communication has been viewed as an interdisciplinary field. literpersonal COMMUsication js
most often linked to studies into lanpuage, social copnition, and social psychology. Prior te the 140s, only x
modest amount of restarch wes completed under the label of interpersonal communication. Heath and B ‘ant
(ROM) marked this time as the origin of the field of imerpersonal cooumunication: “Particularly sine Hs
