i. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION
Comumerciglization of culture in the United States had gone far cael i

| Europe. Further, the prevalence of adyverticin rat a Shae ai

Bin the United States wis something wi i
in Europe. The closest thing in Adornos experience to the advertising industry i a ave
wits fasciat propaganda (Jiger, 2104, p. 122). Adorne was later ta allude to his experience wlth
the Princeton Radio Regearch Project in the eetay on the culture industry by noting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that be saw this research as being indistinguishable fram political
propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did
not agree on the value of enupirical studies, and Adorno left the project, Adornos dissatisfaction with
the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop
the idea of the culture industry.

Because of the relationship hetweern fhe Institute for Secial Research and Columbia University,
Horkheimer, who had already moved te California, conld not tring Adomiea fo the Heat Qoart until
November 1941, When Adora mes finally able te relocate, he joined an expatriate community tad
included Frits Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Bister, Thomas ond Heimrich Mann, Alfred Dakin, ona
Bertolt Brecht, several of stich found work in the Hollywood monie industry. The fact that Aderna
was port of this tifeliectual community whose members were tevotved in the production of Hollywood
matics tual hove had some influence in developing Ais thongits on culture, aince the Hollywood ayatem
inhibited the creative freedom thot many of the expatriates had enjayed in Weimar Germany.

These preconditionsAdornos interest in music, bis friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radia Project, as well a5 invalverment with the expatriate community in California and the
Telationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important to an widerstanding af

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radia did not bother to present itself as art, They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
{Horkhelmer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adama referred to a& Pordist
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl,
1995, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adomowere the Hollywood production syetem, of
the CES radio network that had been assoclated with the Princeton Haclio Hesearch Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula eupplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
2002. p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there woukd not be any real change to the system,
and thar nothing truly adversarial to the syatem would emerge (Horkbeimer and Adorno, 2002, p.
106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reagirm the ayetem, and Adarna cited Oran Welles
as an example of someone whe was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system wold
allow it te assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual
(Friedman, 1981, p. 165), Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
f social control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freccdacn to chinase lina syste of eeomomic
coercion ultimately meant the freedom to be the same (Horkheimer and Adarna, 202, B. 134i). -
Since Adorno had been, ia bis essays on qnusic and radio, an apparent defender of high art, The
Culture Industry het been criticized as being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture.
Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer andl
Adore, 2002, p. 101}. It was not high art that Adorno was presenting a5 an alternative to the culture
industry, but madernism. Although he provides the idea of an opposing force to the culture industry,
Adorno provides no overt Marxist analysis. Instead, he notes in passing that the dominant system
utilized capacities for mass consumption for entertainment or amusement, : '
