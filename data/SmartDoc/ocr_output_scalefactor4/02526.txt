: According to Rogers (1465), diffusion refers to “the process hy which an inmevalkon is
nicated through certain channels over time among the members ala social system. An mani
is. an idea, practice oe object perceived as mew by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffe
son of inrkvations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” ip. 40%).
That is, by sharing communication channels such a5 interpersonal onMunacalion oF Mass commu-
nication peaple can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation aa useful. Laswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, 5-M-C-R-E
(cg. sender-mcssage-chanmel-reociver-efect) Rogers (155) mentioned, “this 5-M-C-R-E comm
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffiasion” (p. 1). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinkin leaders, (2) message can be a new ides or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal of mass conmmunicabion, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, andl finally
(3) the effects con be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theery, ‘Time’ variable
is a very important factor. According 6 Ropers (1905), time variable is invalved in diffesiom in (1)
the lemowation-decision process, (2) innovaliveness; (3) an innewation’s rate of adopehin. Micet anmce
