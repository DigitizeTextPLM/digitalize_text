CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in it fluencing
public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase,
the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more
than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity and
propaganda (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent 4 different view of
the formation of public OPTLOn In opposition to PICA, who views the public as henge easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernaye (1928) offers the idea
that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial. [t must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept ip. 66).

Bernaye elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as @ tool that can be
weed to combine the ideas of the public and the perswader. The objective-minded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, o7 helps the public adjust to it (Bernays,
1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
saciehy. but atill also claims that THAT Plato afl the peli ifs possible . Bernays (1952) writes ot the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made hy others,
and to persuade or suggest courses of action (p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as

Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Losewell, Eliul, and Sernays are importane for a number of

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the direct effects and limited effects

media models. Theorists such as Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby

propaganda coruld directly influence the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippmann
also noted that the media might not be influencing only thought, but may also be influencing what
people thought about. It was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting point for future research
in the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work of
Lyengar and Kinder, as well ag WieCombs and Shaw. Overall, the research of the scholars diseussed i
