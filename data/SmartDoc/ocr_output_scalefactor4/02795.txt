Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting t

manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be

used to combine the ideas of the public and the pereuader. The objectheminded public relations
man helps his client aijust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernaye,
1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
society, but still aleo claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Gernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
