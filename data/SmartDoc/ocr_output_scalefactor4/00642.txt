i. GENESIS OF "TRE CULTURE IMOLATRE"

1 Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry as well a6 its reception the concept can be
examined chronalogically, from its pre-conditions, through its generation, 10 its subsequent impact, The idea of
the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, is developed through insights into the mechanical re-
production of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music, but also be Hollywood
movies, That this is so prows out of a number of historical contingencies.

Adomo was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin
never received a degree that would allow him to teach ata university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno
became in effect Benjamins only pupil. After Benjamin’s death “it was Adomo who then introduced a rational-
ized version of his ideas into academic philosophy." (Jager, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had
ah impact on the development of Adoras thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began
teaching, at the Institute. Adorn lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi
party, Horkheimer bad already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switeerland, and the Institute: bean
aperaling there. The Mazis rise to pawer not only meant that Adomo lost his job and would eventually force his
departure fram Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jorgen Habermas would Later note, tie
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historleal expe-
riences Influencing the development of critical theary, the others being Stalinist repression and the production
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48).

Adomo was at Oxford from 1934 to 1938, where he worked on a manuscript on Husserl. He was considered
an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frank-
furt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the late
1930s Adomo evidenced litthe hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adormo debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's mare
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adomo lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a comecrt hall, symphonic works could
now be heard aver the radio, and could be reproduced om phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adama was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adorno, 20015, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adora, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity, To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the topahe original or Idea- to down of layers of imitations, to Adamo, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adomo. Im 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Inatitute of Social Research with Columbia University that coabled the Institute to continue working in
New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, run by Paul Lazars-
feld, Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although he later claimed that he did not Know what a “radio project” was. For his part,
Lavarsfeld looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be an expert on music, Adomo
wrote for the Project's journal in 1941, reiterating bis position that radio was only an image of a live perfor-
mance. In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio industry that the medium was bringing serious music
to the masses (Wigeershaus, 1994, p. 243). While working at the Princeton Radio Research Project Adomo
became shocked at the degree to which culture had become commercialized in the United States.
