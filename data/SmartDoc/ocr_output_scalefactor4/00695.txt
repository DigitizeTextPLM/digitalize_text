Adoma was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin

never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adomo
became in effect Benjamins only pupil. After Benjamin’s death “it was Adorno who then introduced a rational-
ized version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (liger, 2004, p. 63-6). The relationship with Benjamin had
an impact on the development of Adomos thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began
teaching al the Institute, Adomo lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi
party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Sedtzerland, and the Institute began
operating there. The Nazis rise to power not only meant that Adorno lost his job and would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As JOrcen Habermas would later note, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was ome of the historical expe-
riences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the proclwetion
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 45).

an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frank
urt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the Late
19305 Adame evidenced littl hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
19305, Benjamin and Ademe debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships, The essay translated as “Un the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adorno lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could
ne re heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was interior to the
original, and Adora was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: 7 Together

impossible” (Adomo, 20016, p. 47) While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph on film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adorno, the aura of the original artwork was the
esseritial of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction ae the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or ldea- to down of lay ens of imitations; to Adamo, mas
production was nothing but the destruction of the authentrcity. The general sititude of the an school
was that of Adorno. In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that aoeones the Tees to continge working in
