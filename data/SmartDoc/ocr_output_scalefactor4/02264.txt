worked at the University of Rechester, but in 144 he followed Lewin to a= re
tute of Technology aod the Research Center for Groap Dynamics. After Lewin death, esiinper
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
{Samelson, 2M, Much of Pestinger’s research folkrwed his mentor Lewin anil fisetbeer developed
Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influestial on the emerging field of anus
terperscnall communication and an the development of WRT, Festinger is best known for the choca’
of Cognitive Dixamance and Social Comparten, Cognitive Dissonance theary (COT) attempted ad
exphin how an ievbalonce among cognitions might affect am individual, Lewin feweshadowed CTF
in his observations regarding amiude change in small groups (Festinger. (982) COT allows for three
relationships bo occur among cognitions: & consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equl-
librium with each other: a dissent relationship. in which cognitices are in competition with each
other; and/an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on ome another

comfort that individuals seek oo reduce. Social Comparison theary postulates chat individuals look bo
foodhack from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual
usually seeks the opinions of ethers who are similar eo the self. This need for social comparison can
result in conformity pressures (Trenhodm & Jensen, SMM). Eberger and Calabrese (1975) related sn-
cal compariacs to WET by siting that “Pestimger has suggested that persons seek oval similar others
who are provcimate when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of
their behavior and‘or opinions ina partecular situation” (p. LOT), Festinger roceteed the Distinguished
Scientist award of the Amencan Paychologeal Assocenin and the Distinguished Semior Scientist
Award [rom the Society of Experimental Social Peychology, Festmper’s legacy i significant, and
his theoretical influence can still be recogniged in comemporary soctl science research. Aronson (in
Festinger, }60) stated, “lt was im this er that Leon Festinger mvented and developed his theory of
cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, social prychology has tet boon the same since” ip. 3).
