the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to

achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence that runs from control to content and from content
to audience’ (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is Ged strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, "Who says what in which channel to whorn and with what effects" (p. 64). Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the
remainder ot his career.

4cide from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how p panda coul
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the nformation that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing

he power of the media that 12 SOMew hal 5 milar to Lippmann s Uaeorbes.
