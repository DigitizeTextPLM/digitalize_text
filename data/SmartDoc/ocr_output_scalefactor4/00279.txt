1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular colture on film and radio did mot bother to present iteelf as art. They were instead
a business, and this in turm became an ideclogy te legitimize the trash they intentionally prochace
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. &5). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitalism, in which mass prochoction based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hobendahl,
1995, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adormmowere the Hollywood production system, or
the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula aupplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorn,
2002, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there wauld mot be any rei] change to the ayatem,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Boe wie Pp
106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only tewirm the system, and Adorno cited Qraon Welles
as an example of someone wha was allowed te break the rules. The elasticity in the system would
allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its awn, ultimately rendering it ineffectual
(Friedman, 1981, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industey was an ald
of soeial control (Horkheimer and Adarna, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of econamic
