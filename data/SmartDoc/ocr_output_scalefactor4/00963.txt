Uses and Gratifications

1.1. Introduction

Wses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media research. The original
conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of
ceftain media coments. The core question of such research is: Why do people use media
and what do they wee them for? (McQuail, 1984). There exisia a basic idea in this approach:
audience members know media conienl, and which media they can use to meel their needs
In the mass communication process, uses and gratiicalions approach puts te function of
linking need gratifications and media choice clearly on ihe side of audience members. It
suggests that people's needs influence whal media they wauld choose, how they use cer
fain media and what gratificalions the media give them. This approach differs from other
iheorelical perspectives in that f regards audiences as active media users as appoded ta
passive receivers of information. In contrast to traditional media efects theories which Tocus
on “what media do to peogle” and assume audianoss are homogeneous, uses and gratifica-
tions approach is moe concemed with “whal people do with media” (Katz, 7656). It alkowe.
audiences personal needs fo ude media and responds to ihe media, which defermined by
their social and psychologecal background. Uses and grattcations appraacn also postulates
thal the media compete with other informabon souroes for audience's need aalislacton (Katz
etal. 1974a). As traditional mace media and new media continue to provide people with a
wide range of media platforms and content, if is consktered one of the most appropriate
perspectives tor investigating why audienees choose to be expomed io differant.

The approach emphasizes audiences’ choice by assessing thelr masons for using
a certain media fo (he disregard of others, ag well as the vaniows gratifications obtained
from the svedia, based on individual social and psychologreal maquirements (Severin
& Tankard, 1997) Asa broader perspective among communication researches, if pro-
victes a framewors for undorstanding the processes by which media participants seek
information or content selectively, commensurate with their needs and interests (Kate
etal, 1974a). Avolence members then Mearparate the content to fulfill their noeds or
fo satishy their interests (Lowery & Nabila, 1383).

1.2 Origin and History

It is well accepted thal communication theories have developed through the realms of pey-
chalogy and sociology over the past 100 year. With illumed by valuable ideas as well as
exploring mong uniilied fiekds in these to disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher
conceptions of understanding media.
