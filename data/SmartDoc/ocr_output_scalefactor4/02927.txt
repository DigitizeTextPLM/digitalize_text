entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of a study that had been done for the

Hacker Foundation, with the involvernent of George Gerbner and others. Tn this oe
warned, rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of oe ue
of psyehological control (Adorno, 2001a, p. 160), It was one of the few occasions in pees
that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found 1

strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part im cultural ae
of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to mE
his thought on the culture industry, For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseudo-cu ture
in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film,
Adora conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 131).

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to
other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideclagy whose main objectives were to
maintain social control and continue ta perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.
Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects

of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions
(Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, it is difficult in Marcuses argument to separate culture
or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass
media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno
had done. In the end Marcuses analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant
ideology, Marcuse wrote, “how can the administered individualswho have made their mutilation

into their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged scaleliberate

themselves from themselves as well as from their masters? How is it even thinkable that the

vicious circle be broken? (Marcuse, 1991, p, 251). Given the pessimistic tone of the book

it is somewhat ironic that largely because of it he would be perceived as an icon for leftist

movements of the 1960s in the U.S. and Germany that d
