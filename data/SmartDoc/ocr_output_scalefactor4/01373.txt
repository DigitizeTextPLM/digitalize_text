1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

rAeieareines is conceived as active, 1.e., an important part of of mass media use is
nee eee ene wo. Patterns of media use are shaped by TREES
meter ons of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience

2. In the mass communication process much initiative in linking need gratification and
ee choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on
. izing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and

avior.

3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
mass communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs,
and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consump-
tion certainly varkes.

4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- ie, people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report thelr interests and motives in
particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal form ulation.

5, Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience orlentations are explored on their own terms. (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous. researches On
pratifications detected diverse gratifications thar attract people on the mextia, they did not ackiress the
connections between these gratifications (Katz et al., 1974a). They suggested thar uses and gratifi-
cations research concern with following aspects: “(1) the social and the psychological onpins of (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which Jead to (5) eif-

Consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones” (Katz et al., 1974b, p- 20). The studies of Katz and
