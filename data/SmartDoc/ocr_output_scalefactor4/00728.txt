The pense gratifications that matlvate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old a5

interested in the reasons for viewing different radio pragrammes, such as saap operas and quizzes, as well
as daily mewspaper (Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 144, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc). Im these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the mediun
itself [Katz et al., 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy thelr listeners with advice,
support, of occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure to the dally routine (Bereison, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
eatisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

ses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the Late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and pratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz 6 served both as a sockologist and as a communication researcher He received his PhO. in So-
cology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the mest thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem, Un the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting, This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in Irisure, culture and communication from the 1900s tolSd0s (UPENN, 2002}. In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Katz's mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, whois one ofthe pioneers of gratifications research.
Ther cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theory model Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
notion that people use the media to thelr benefit. Ina study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject
which is known asthe uses and gratifications research were explored, They viewed the mass media = aneere
