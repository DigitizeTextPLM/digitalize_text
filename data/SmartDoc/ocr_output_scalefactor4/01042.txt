In the mass communication process, uses and gratifications approach puts the function of
linking need gratifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience members. It
suggests that people’s needs influence what media they would choose, how they use cer-
tain media and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs irom other
theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users as opposed to
passive receivers of information. In contrast to traditional media effects theories which focus
on “what media do to people” and assume audiences are homogeneous, uses and gratifica-
tions approach is more concerned with “what people do with media” (Katz, 1959). It allows
audiences personal needs to use media and responds to the media, which determined by
their social and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates
that the media compete with other information sources for audience's need satisfaction (Katz
et al., 1974a). As traditional mass media and new media continue to provide people with a
wide range of media platforms and content, it ig considered one of the most appropriate
perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be exposed to different.
The approach emphasizes audiences’ choice by assessing their reasons for using

a certain media to the disregard of others, as well as the various gratifications obtained
from the media, based on individual social and psychological requirements (Severin
& Tankard, 1997). Asa broader lari among crane at deat = Sa it aoe
