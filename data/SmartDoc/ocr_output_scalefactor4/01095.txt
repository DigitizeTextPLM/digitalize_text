in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when Writing the essay Transparencies on Film

the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahil, 1995, p. 131).

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to
other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideclogy whose main objectives were bo
maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that contral.
Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indectrination functions
(Marcuse, 1901, Pp. 8). However, it 1s difficult in Marcuses argument to separate culture
or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish ee or mass
media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the Pane yee at Ader =
had done. In the end Marcuses analysts of society allowed for no gee ue ee
ideology. Marcuse wrote, "how can the administered individualswho have eit re an
