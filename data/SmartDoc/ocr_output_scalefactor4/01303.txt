The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted ta certain media ls almost as ell as
empirical mass communication research itself (MeCluail, 1983). Dating back to the 19405, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well
as dally newspaper |Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc.]. In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by same specific content or by the medium
self [Katz et al. 1974b). For instance, radia soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice,
SUppOrt, oF Occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelon, 149), For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
Up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era, Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu atz is ome of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establiching the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz is served both as 8 sociologist and asa communication researcher, He received his Ph.D. in 5o-
tidlogy in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the nest thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerugalem. In the late 160, invited by the Government of israel, Kate headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience bed to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and cormmunication from the 1970s to1S90s (UPEMM, 2001). in
1942, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Penniylvania, and alto directed its
expenmental Scholars programm for post-doctoral study,

Kate’s mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, whe if one of the pioneers of pratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theeny model, Later, Katz intraduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
notion that people use the media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject
whieh is known as the uses and gratifications research were explored. They viewed the mass media a5 a means
by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to
their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Matz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumier, Katz published a callection of essays on grattications in 1974 which
were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication. They teak a more humanistic approach to looking at media
use They suggest that media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the wer and
they have alternate choices to satisfy their need. (Blumnber & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that media
served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission for both society

and individuals (Blurnler and Katz, 1974).
