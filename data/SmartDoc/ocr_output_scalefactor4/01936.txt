11. Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-

abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation Bist communication
research and the develogment of communication theory. Information exchange is a basic human functron in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal af reducing uncertainty. Omcer-
frinty Reduction theary (URT), accredited te Charles R. Berger and Richard J, Calabrese (1975), recognined that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development of UIT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research, Heath and Bryant (2000) state; “One of the motivations underpinning imerpersenal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 143). The study of information is. basic
to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal cammumication, WRT places the role ef communication inte the central
focus which wns a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they buve tended to employ social psychological theories as starting points” (p. 99).
The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporarica marked the emergence af inber-
personal communication research; with the development af URT, communication researchers began to look to
communication for theories af greater understanding mther than theoretical approaches founded in other social
