| Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- Le., people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in
particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous researches on
gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people on the media, they did mot address the
connections between these gratifications (Katz et al,, 1974a). They suggested that uses and gratifi-
cations research concern with following aspects: “(1) the soclal and the psychological origins of (2)
needs which generate (4) expectations of (4) the media or other sources which lead to (5) dif-
ferential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in (6) need gratification and (7) other
consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones” (Katz et al., 1974b, p. 20). The studies of Katz and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the uses and gratifications approach. Since
then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The current status of uses and
@ratifications is still based on Katz's first analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in

1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience mem-
bers. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication mes-
sage for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different
individuals. There is not only one way that people uses media, Contrarily, there are as many reasons
for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974). :

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's backgrownd, such as experience, i
education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and hich cate ieee
needs, That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications

interactions” to classify four important media gratifications mais
