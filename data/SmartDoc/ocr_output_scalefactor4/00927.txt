According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovalon is commu
nicated through certain channels over time among the members af a social system. An Innewation
is an idea, practice of object perceived a5 new by an iedividual or other wnit of adopeion. The diffu-
sion of innewations involves both mass medias are] interpersonal communication channels” (p. 4.
‘That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal GOMMunicalion of Mass oomiiu-
nication people can get information of an innervation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(148) presemed a well-known model af comenunication that is analyzed as five parts, 5-MAC-R-E

fe.g.. sendor-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers 1995) mentioned, “this 5-M-C-R-E comenu-
nlemtiion model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (pe 19) Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors of opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new thea oo product, (3) channels can be
imerpersonal or mass Communication, (4) receivers Che be members of a social eystem, and finally
(2) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. Inthe diffusion theory, “Time’ variable
