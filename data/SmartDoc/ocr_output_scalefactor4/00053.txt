|, NEEDS AND GRATIFICATHONS

Five basic assumptions were staned ina soudy of Kate, Blumer, afd Gureviteh in 1974 as follows.

They provide a framework for understanding the coerelation between media and audiences:

L The audience is conceived as active, i.e, am important part of of mass redia wee is.
aeucned tn be goal oriented ... patterns of media use are shaped by mane or less
definite expectations of what certain kinds of coment hawe to offer the aadience
member.

In the mass Communication process och initiative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a stromg limitation on.
thearizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content an attinades and
behavior

The media compete wich other sources af need satisfaction. The needs served by
mass communication coretilube bast a segenenc of the wider range of human needs,
and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consumnp-
thon certainly wares.

Methedologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use-can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members ihemselves- Le, people
are ualficiently sell-aware te be able co report their interests and motives in
particular cases, ew at least co recognize them when confronted with then im an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation,

. Walue judgments about the culeural significance of mass communication shedald be
suspended while audience orientations ane explored om chelr own terms. (p. 15-17).

In achdicion, Katz, Blumer, and Gurevitch also commented that, alihough previous researches on
gratifications devected diverse gratificarions that amract people on the media, they did nat address the
connections between these pratificainons (Katz et al. |. They soggested thar uses and wralili-
cations research concern with (olbowiing aspects: “(14 the social and the psychological origins of (2)
needs which generate (7) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead oo (5) dif-
ferential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting im (h) need gratification and (7) caher
Tonsequences, pechape mostly unintended ones" (Kate et al., 1374b, p. 20), The studies of Katz and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundaion of bailing the wus and gratificarons approach. Since
ihen, the research on this subject has been strengihened and extended, The current stams of uses and
Bratifications is still based om Katz's first analysis, particularly as mew media farms have emerged in
such an electronic information age when people have more options of media use,

1) Needs and Gratifications

Leet and gratificanors approach emphasizes motives amd che self-perceived needs of auchere
bers. Blumler and Katz (1974) conclu that differen people can use the came carina
wet for very didterent purposes. The same media conent may gratify different needs for different
viduals, There is notonly one way thar people uses media Contrarily, there are as many reascns
