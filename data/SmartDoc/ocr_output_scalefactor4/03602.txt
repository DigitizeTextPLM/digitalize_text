clology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 19705 to1990s (UPENN, 2001). In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study. ones

Katz's mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsteld, who one ofthe pioneers of gratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that conmect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with oe
notion that people use the media to their benefit. Ina shudy by Katz, Gurevitch amd Haas (1973), a subject
