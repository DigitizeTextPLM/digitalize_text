2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capit alist society into a systematic context, as opposed to
ather writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p a0). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social eantral mechanisms in advanced industrial society asics
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reite, 2000, p. 144) Capital at
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive

afiuence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescenl fAlway, 1995, p. 83)
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were to
maintain social eontrol and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control

Echoing Adorno, Warcuse wondered whether the information ard entertainment aspects
nf? mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination fumetions
(Marcuse, 1991, p. 4): However, it is difficalt in Warcuses argument to separate culture
mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture of mass
totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno
