were published without their permission in 1249, Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing
themselves from their own work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the late
1040s the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises in 1951. Horkheimer
became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954 Adorno published an essay
entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of a study that had been done for the
Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner and others. In this essay Adorno
warned, rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed
of peychological control (Adorno, 2001a, p. 160), It was ome of the few occasions in the 1950s
that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments
of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adarne would nonetheless on occasion attempt bo reshape
his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture
vn the United States (Adorno, 1993. p. 71), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1964 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In L066, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film,
Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition ta
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hobendahl, 1995, p. 131).

ideological ends, for Marcuse aoeial conteol mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensube
the wholesale integration ef the individual inbo roass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144]. Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a syaterm of repressive
affluence that kept elements af sockety satisfied und quiescent ( Alway, 1995, p. 43). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were to
