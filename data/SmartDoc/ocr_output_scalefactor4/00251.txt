Media's effects towards people. For example, a model often used in the the-

and gratifications approach.

; The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as
Empincal mass communication research itself (MeQuail, 1983]. Dating hack to the 1940s, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio pragrammes, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well
a5 Cally newspaper |Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1444, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc), In these
studies, researchers discovered a Gat of functions served either by some specific cantent or by the medium
itself (Katz et al, 1974b). For instance, radia soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice,
support, OF doeasions for emotional release (Herog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared tapics
of conversation and a structure to the daily routine [Berelson, 1949), For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s tll 1970s when television has grown

Up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach,

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and asa communication researcher, He received his Ph.0. in So-
cidlagy in 1936 from Columbéa University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
aity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government of lsrael, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience bed to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s to1990s (UPEMM, 2001), In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and abe directed its
eaperimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Katz's mentor in Columbia University it Paul Lavarsfeld, who one of the ploneers of gratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theory model, Later, Kate introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
notion that people use the media to their benefit. in a study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), 4 subject
which is known as the uses and gratifications research were emplored, They verwed the mass media as a means
by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and faund that people bend the media ta
their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published a collection of essays an gratifications in 1974 which
were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication. They took a more humanistic approach to looking at media
use, They suggest that media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the user and
they have alternate choices to satisfy their need. (Blumer & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that media
served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission for both society
and Individuals (Blumer and Katz, 1974).
