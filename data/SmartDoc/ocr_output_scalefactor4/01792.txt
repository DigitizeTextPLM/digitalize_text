A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. itis the social part of
language, iis essentially a collective contract which ane must accept in its entiraty if one
wishes to communicate. lt is because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming from € single individual and is consequently a social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is beth institution and system, speach is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. Itis bacause speech is
essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual act and notte a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1967, op, 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system inte two paris, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which i expressed thraugh the torn.
The form is called the signifier, which is the extemal part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the extemal forms expressing the @ctual animal dog, Mere, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. “| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifé) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts” (Saugsura, 1959, in PL liars
(ed), p. 37). The correspondence of ihe conceptimeaning to the external fonm is notin the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbetrary relation. itis not the inevitable intarmal relation but the difference
between the signs that operates ihe signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that language dies:
not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning fram
within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences’. According to Saussure, Real
