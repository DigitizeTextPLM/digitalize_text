sion theory in such flelds as geography, economics, psychology. political science, and, as previcessly
mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 20 because he was

According ta Rogers (1AS), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innowaion fs comime-
nicoted through certain channels over time among the members ofa social system. An innovation
is on idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit af adoption. The diffu-
slog. of innovatioes iewalves both mass evedia and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 405").
That is, by sharing communication channels such as inkenpersonal communicaiion OF Brus COMMmu-

(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analysed & five parte, $-M-C-R-E
(eg. sender-messape-channel-receiver-eflieet), Rogers (1585) mentioned, “this 5-M-C-R-E comma-
nication model comesponds closely to the elements of diffusion" (p. 19) Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventocs or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a mew idea or product, (3) channels can be
