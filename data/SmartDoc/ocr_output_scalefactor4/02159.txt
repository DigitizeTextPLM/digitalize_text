that Adora would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least ane obeerver found. it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did mot take part im cultural developments
wf the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adorna would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape
his thought on the culture industry. For examplt, in 1959 he wrote af a universal pseudo-culture
in the United States (Adorno, 1995, p. 21}, and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1983 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film,
Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in Opposition to
the culture industry, within the context of modernism {Hohendall, 195, p- 141}.

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitallst society inta a systematic context, as opposed to
other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p, 609). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social comteol mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144), Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1305, p. a3). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whese main objectives were bo
maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.
Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination funetions
(Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, it is difficult in Marcuses argument to separate culture
or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass
media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno
had done. In the end Marcuses analysis of society allowed for na opposition to the dominant
ideology. Marcuse wrote, â€œhow can the administered individualswho have made their mutilation
into their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged Age SE ne
themselves from themselves as well as from their masters! How is it even thiokable that the
vicious circle be broken? (Marcuse, 1991, p. 251). Given the pessimistic tone of the anit
it is somewhat ironic that largely because of it he would be perceived as an icon Ra leftist
