Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a basic human function in

tainty Reduction theory (URT), accredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars
pioncered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research. Heath and Bryant (20()) state: “SQne of the motivations underpinning interpersonal cOMmMuUnicHlion
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce unce rtainty” (p. 153). The study of information is basic
to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertamt) in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the role of communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories as starting points” (p. 99).
The research underlying the theory and efforls made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of inter-
personal commu nication research: with the development of URT, communication researchers began to look to
communication for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social

sciences.

1.2 The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Traditionally, communication has been viewed as an interdisciplinary field. Interpersonal CMT SRA 13
most often linked to studies into language, social cognition, and social psyc hology. Pr ior to the 1940s, only a
modest amount of research wis completed under the label of interpersonal communic ation Heath amd Naat
(2000) marked this time as the origin of the field of interpersonal communication: “Particularly since 1960,
scholars adopted communication as the central tenn because They wanted ae i a a stele anal ne
aspect at human behavior’ (p. 35). The 1460s produced reseurch that impacted the development of am in-
