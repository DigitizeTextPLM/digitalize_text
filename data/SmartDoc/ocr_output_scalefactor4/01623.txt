1. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in
Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertleing in the United States was something with no correlative
in Europe. The closest thing in Adornos experience to the advertising industry in the United States
was fasclet propaganda (Jager, RIM, p. 122), Adorno was later to allude to his experience with
the Princeton Radio Hesearch Project in the esay on the culture industry by noting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda (Horkheimes and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). Tt became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did
Tot agree on the value of emplrical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adornos dissatisfaction with
the work af the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop
the idea of the culture industry.

Because of the relationship detween the Jnatitete for Social Reacarch ond Cotemiia University,
Horkheimer, who had already moved to California, could not bring Adorno to the West Cogat until
November 1941, When Adorno wee finally ofe to relocate, Ae joined an expatriate community that
included Frits Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Mons Sister, Thomas ond Meinnick Mann, Alfred DoWin, and
Bertolt Brecht, sereral of which fownd work in dhe Holywood movie industry. The fact fhat Adorno
was port of this intellectwal community sehose members were innolved in the production of Hollywood
totes met hove had some influence in developing Ais thoughts on culture, since the Hollsauoed syetem
inhibited he creative freedor that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany.

These preconditionsAdernes interest in music, bis friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the
relationship of several of these to the Hollywood fllm industryare all important te an understanding of
his concern for the idea af the culture indusiry.

1) The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorn, papular culture on film and radia did not bother to present iteelfas art, They were instead
a business, amd this in tuo beau: an ideology to Jepitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adormmo, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitis, in which mass production based on the techolgues used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were baged an centralization and lerarchy (Hohendahl,
1955, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specifed by Adormmowere the Hollywood production system, or
the CES radin network that bad been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
S02, p. SO). Mechanical reprodwetion ensured that there would mot be any real change to the system,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adomo, D002, p.
106-7). Paradoxically, any innevation would only reaffirm the system, and Adotno cited Orson Welles
a8 an example of someone who was allowed to break the roles, The elasticity in the system would
allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineflectual
(Friedman, 1991, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
of social control [Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom te chose in a system of economic

Adorno, 2008, p. LOL). It was not high art that Adormo was presenting ac an alternative to the culture
industry, bot modernism. Although he provides the idea of an opposing force to the culture industry,
Adora provides no overt Marxist analysis. Instead, he notes in passing that the dominant system
utilized capacities for mass consumption for entertainment of amusement,

Since Adorno had been, in his essays on music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, The
Culture Industry had been criticized as being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture.
Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkhelmer and
Adore, 2002, p. LOL).
