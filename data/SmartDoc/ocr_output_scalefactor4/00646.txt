Like marry other etnacturalist scholars. Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural linguistics.
To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system andthe varale
by speaking aciors. The former is called langue and the laher parole. Langue is the systemaszed
of conventions raceséary 10 communication, indifferent to be material of the signal which compose
fk as opposed bo A, speech (parok) & Covers the purely individual part of language (Barthes, 1957,
p13). Bates interprets Saussures lingucshe eyaham within the aociaal cimension. The siruciure ewe,
langum, is the social Convention oF value shared through asociety which i staniized and standardized.
On the contrary, parole i flexible because i ig the achual expresso al the indridual level. Howewe!,
itis considered relatively flexible due to the fact that apeech by an individual cannot be free from the
shared convention, te structure

A language is therefore, ~& socal institution and a system of values. If tne social part af
language, iis essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entinety if one

resists the modifications coming fram a Bingie individual and ig consequently a social instr
lution. In contrast to language, whieh is both inatitution and syslem, apanech if eecenbially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The tonaking dubject can wpe the code

epeation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 74-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausure cestinguishes the language system into wo parts, the
signified and tra signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through (he form.
The dorm ia called the signifier. which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in Engieh of in Korean are the exiamal fons expresting the aciyal animal dog. Hare, the actual
animal. fhe content in question, becomas the signified. “I propose to retain the word dign (signe to
designale the whole and bo replsce concept and soundimage respectively by signified (signifi) ard
signifier (sageificant); the last tens tena Pane the acheantage of indicating the opposition thal sapa-
rates them from each other and trem the whole of which trary are parte” (Saussure, 1968, in FR. lenis
edo p37). The correspondence of the conceplimeaning bo the |idemal form is not in the destined
rédation, but nether, in the arbhrary relation. itis nel the inevitaole inbernal relation but the difference:
betamen the signs that operates the sgrifying aysiam. Saussure (7900) argues that “language does

2002, p. 29). Ad a grammatical set of siges or the underlying systematic order, the symtag-
matic compeises a pentence, and the paradigmatic means 2 field of possible siges that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities im selecting the sige within the
