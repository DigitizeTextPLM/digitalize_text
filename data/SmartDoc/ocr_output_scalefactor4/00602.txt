to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
(2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally

(3) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theary, ‘Time’ variable
| IS a Very important factor, According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process: (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables
that influence how and why users and audience adapt a new information medium, such as the Internet
According to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even though in the
past the individual is usually the unit of analysis, Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in
adopting new media because new media are interactive tools and thus are required by many users to
gain efficiency. That is, the more people use, the more people get benefits. In this sense, diffusion
theory not only can apply to practical things, but also can be related to digital divide.
There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Tnnovativeness:
“(1) [Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (3) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185). Rogers detined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p, 40), Figure | shows the relationships between os
