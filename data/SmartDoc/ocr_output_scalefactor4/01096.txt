As Lippmann wes writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undemaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In
fact, guuch of che propaganda that Lasswell was examining was acoaally being writen by Lippmann himself
(Rogers, 1584).

Harold Lasewell (1900-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on
contocting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the coment of propaganda,
anél iscowering the effect of propaganda on the mas nce (Rogers, 1d), Lewwell is credined with creating
the THs Communicates procedure ol coment analysis (Rogers, 1998), Gere Onmcmt analysis cam be
defined as," .the investigation of communication messages by calegoriting message conten ince classifications
in order io measure certain variables" (Roger, 16), In ae essay entitled “Contents of Communication,”
Lasswell (1546) explains that a conte: analysis should take imo account the frequency with which certain

symbol appear ina message, the direction in which the symbols ory to pervade the audiences opdmiom, and

sity of the symbols gus By enidertandieg the content af the message, Lasswell (145) aims to

schieve the geal of undersianding the “siream of influence that rans from control to conten! and from content

to audience” (p. 74).

shape public opinion. This deals primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasewelll wan fuirticularty
