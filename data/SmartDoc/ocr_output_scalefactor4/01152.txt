I. OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1 Other Propaganda Theorists

1.1 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses af Tap 7
fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himse
eee ee (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research, He focused on
and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswell is credited with creating
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994), Generally, content analysis can be
defined as, *...the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content inte classifications
in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994), In an essay entitled “Contents of (Communicacion,”
Lasewell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1545) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the “steam of influence that runs from control to content and from content
Wo audience” [p. Fay.

This metheed of content analysis is tied strongly to Lacswell (1953) early definition of communication which
sated, “Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" (p. 84). Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, amd Laswell went on to doa lot of work within this area during the
remainder of his carne,

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinian within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasiwell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information chat is presented to them,
4nd also apprehensive to accept it, However, it is still chat information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, afd is being presented to them by the government, This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that ls somewhat similar to Lippmann's theories.

L2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

4 approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,

Edward Bernays (1691-1995) was examining public relations, propapanda, amd public opinion. Bermnays (1928)
defines Propapanda fs, a CONSISTENT, encuring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of a
public to an enterprise, ides, of group (p. 25). Contrary to other Propaganda theorists, Bernays recognizes

that propaganda can he either beneficial or harmful wo the public, It can help in
