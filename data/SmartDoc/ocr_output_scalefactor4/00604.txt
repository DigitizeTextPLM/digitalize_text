operating there. The Nazis rise to power not only meant that Adorne loat his job and would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but-also affected his philosophical thought, As Jorgen Habermas would later note, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was ane of the historical expe-
riences influencing the development of critical theory, the athers being Stalinist repression and the production
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48). ;

Adomo was at Croford from 1994 to 1998, where he worked on a manuseripton Husserl. He was considered
an owisider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frank-
furt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime mowed to the United States. Already in the late
1930s Adoreo evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
19305, Benjamin amd Adame debated mass culture, since film and radia became the fo most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships, The essay translated a3 “On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
oplimistic essay, “The Work of Act in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction™ (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62), A pre
mary prablens for Adorno lay in the fact that instead of belng enjoyed ina concert hall, symphonic works could

impossible” (Adama, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or fllin
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tled to clais, ta Adomo, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authemticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea- to down of layers of imitations: to Adorno, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adora, In 193% Max Horkbeimer, who had succeeding im establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to contioge working in
New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, run by Faul |
feld. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although he tater claimed that be did mot know what a “radio project” was, For his part,
