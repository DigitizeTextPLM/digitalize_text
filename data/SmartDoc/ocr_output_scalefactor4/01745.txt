According to Rogers (1996), diffusion re

is an ides

among the members of a social system. An Innovation

s1on of Innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p, 409%.
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu-
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful, Lasswell

(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-C-R-E
(¢.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this S-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variable
is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inn
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research nas attempted fo explain the variables
that influence how and why users and audience adopt a new information medium, Such ae te disfernat
