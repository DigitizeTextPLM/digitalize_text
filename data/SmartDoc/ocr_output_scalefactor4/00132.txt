Other Propaganda Theorists

empirical analyses of propa ganda. In

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking

fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining wa5 sens being
(Rogers, 1294).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on
conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understi anding the content of propaganda,

and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswell is credite dwith creating

the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers | 1994). Generally, content analysis can be

defined as, "...the inv estigation | of communication messages by catego izing messa2e COnLEnE into cl: Pea Masie a
in order to measure certain variables” (Rogers, 1994), In an essay entitled “Contents of Communication,"
Lasswell (1 046) explains that a content an: ilysi should take inte acoount the frequency Y Wi ith white hh certain

symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try te persuade the audience's opinion, and

By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1546) aims to

the intensity of the symbols used,
intent and fram content

achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that runs from central to 0
to audience” (p. 7-4).

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication wit
slated, “Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects” (p. 84). Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a fot of w fork within this area during the
remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content at propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how PPOpaBanca Com Ld
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects ot the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,

and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still that information that is atfecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing

the power of the media thar is somewhat similar to Lippmann's theories

1.2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion, Bemays (1928)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of a

public to an enterprise, idea, or group (p. 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bernays recognizes
that propaganda can be either beneticial or harmful to the public. Tt can help individuals decide what to think
about of alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to society's functioning as a whole.
“We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by

Bemays states,
. Wast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live

men we have never beard of
together as a smoothly functioning soclery (p. 9).

Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be modified, and that such shaping is a necessary part of
society, Bernays pursued his work in the field of public relations. “Public relations is the attempt, by information,
persuasion, and adjustment, to engineer public support for an activity, cause, movement, or institution” (Hemays,
1955, p. 3). In the Engineering of Consent, Bernays (1555) lays out the framework for understanding the public
and developing a public relations campaign. Bermays (1955) claims that the key to a successful public relations
campaign is adjustment of the campaign to the attitudes of varlous groups in society, gathering information
to effectively express an idea, and finally, utilizing persuasion to influence the public opinion in the intended
direction.

Bernays’ theories represent a step forward for mass communication theory. They move away from more

typical presentations of “hit-or-miss propaga nda,” and move toward a deeper
