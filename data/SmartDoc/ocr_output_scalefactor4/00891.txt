1990s Adame evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adomo debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two mest popular ee
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “On ine Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin 5 more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adome lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adomo was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adorno, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adomo, the aura of the otiginal artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity, To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea- to down of layers of imitations: to Adora, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity, The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adomo. In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relation ship for the
Institute of Social Research with Colombia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in
New Work, obtained a position for Adorne at the Prinecton Radio Research Project, run by Paul Lazars-
feld. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, acce pted
the position, although he later claimed that he did not know what a “radin project” was, For his part,

never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adomo
became in effect Benjamins only pupil, After Benjamin's death “it was Adora who then ffrwdaced ‘ eheae
