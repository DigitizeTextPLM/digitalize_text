I, OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1 Other Propaganda Theorists

11) Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harald Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda, In
fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself
(Rogers, 1954).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda Tesearch. He focused an
conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda,
and discovering the effect of propaganda onthe mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Laswell is credited with creating
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis can be
defined as, “...xhe investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classifications
in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994), In an essay entitled “Contents of Communication,"
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should cake into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols cry to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the intensity af the symbals used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that runs from control te content and from content
to audience” (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is tied strangly to Lasswell (1953) early definition af communication which
stated, "Whe saya what in which channel ta whoen and with what effects” (p. 4), Content analysis was eS5en-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the
remainder af his career.

Aside from urederstanding the cantent of prapaganda, Lasswell was alsa interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion, This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,

and also apprehensive to accept ft. However, itis still that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, ated is being presented to them by the government, This is an interesting way af viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories.

1.2 Edward Bernays (1891-1955)

At approximately the same time that Lippmans and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Berays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bermays (1926)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring elfoet to create or shape events to influence the relations of a
public to an enterprise, idea, or group (p. 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bernays recognizes
that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful ta the public. It can help individuals decide what ta think
about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to society's functioning a5 a whole.
Bemays states, “We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, aur ideas suggested, largely by
men we have never beard of... Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are oo live
together as 4 smoothly functioning soclery (p. 9).

Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be modified, and that such shaping i a necessary part of
society, Bemays pursued his work in the field of public relations. “Public relations bs the atvenipt, by information,
persuasion, ad adjustmeit, 00 engineer public suppart foran activity, Cause, Movement or institutian” (Remays,
1955, p. 3). Jn the Engineering of Consent, Bernays (1955) lays out the rome work for understanding the public
and developing @ public relations compaign. Bernays (1955) claims that the key to 4 successful public relations
campaign is adjuement of the campaign to the attitudes af various groups in sociesy, gathering infarmation
to effectively express an idea, amd finally, utilizing persuasion to influence the public opinion in the intended
direction

Bermays® theories represent a step forward for mass communication theory, They move away from more
typical presentations of “hit-or-miss propaganda,” and mave toward a deeper
