1, DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially facused on persuasion,
social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, bal-
ance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology,
played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider,
Kelley, and Hovland, By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction,
relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars
as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the decade

anid inte the 190s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger became popular
along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson.
Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal comm research
agenda during the past two decades” (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus
on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as
a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically
focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution ef relationships. It has been recognized
that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).
Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has
contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus
on those theorists whe pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work
is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our

understanding of interpersonal processes.

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of comunu-
nication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined
and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1945) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there
was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal.
&hannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work

uted to the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the

to predict and explain what will pecur in future interactions. When high uncertainty exists tt is often
