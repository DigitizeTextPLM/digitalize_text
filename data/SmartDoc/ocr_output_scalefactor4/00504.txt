1. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commerciglization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything be had seen in
Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative
in Europe. The closest thing in Adornos experience to the advertising industry in the United State:
was fascist propaganda (Jager, RIM, p. 122), Adorno was later to allude to his experience with
the Princeton Padio Hesearch Project in the esay on the culture industry by nvting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaguuda (Horkbeimer and Adorno, SING, p. 97). [t became obvious that Lazarsbeld and Adorno did
not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adornos dissatisfaction with
the work af the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him te further develop
the idea of the culture industry.

Becauge of the relahionship detween the Institute for Social Research and Cotemita University,
Horkhetmer, who fad aiready moved te California, conld not bring Adora to the Weel Cogat until
November 1941, When Adorno sss finally ole to relocate, Ae joined an expatriate community thot
included Fits Lang, Arnold Schoenderg, Hane Buster, Thomas ond Meinnickh Mann, Alfred Dobin, ond
Bertolt Brecht, seneral of which found work in dhe Hollywood mote industry. The foot that Adorno
was port of this intellectnad community whose members were inmolved in the production of Hollywaod

These precenditionsAdornes interest in music, bis friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, as well as invalyement with the expatriate community ln California and the
relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important te an understanding of
his concern for the idea af the culture indusiry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adarna, papular colbure on film and radia did not bother to present itself as art, They were instead
a business, amd this in turn bese an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitilism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were baged an centralization and luerarchy (Hohendahl,
1965, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specifed by Adormmowere the Hollywood production system, or
the CES radix network that bad been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
S102, p. GO). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would mot be any real change to the system,
and that nothing truly adversirial to the eystem would emerge [Horkheimer and Adomo, 2002, p.
106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaftinm the system, and Adotno cited Orson Welles
a8 an example of sonveone whe was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would
allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it Ineflectual
(Friedman, 1981, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
of social control [Horkbeimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom te chogse in a system of economic
coercion ultimately meant the freedom to be the same (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 136).

Since Adorno had been, in hic ecsaye on music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, The
Culture Industry has been criticized as being a defense of high art, a8 opposed te popular culture.
Adorno spectiically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and
Adorno, 2008, p. LOL). It was mot high art that Adormo was presenting as an alternative to the culture
industry, bot modernism. Although he provides the idea of an opposing force to the culture industry,
Adomo provides no avert Marxist analyela. Instead, he notes in passing that the dominant system
utilized capacities for mass consumption for entertainment or amusement,

Since Adorno had been, in his essays on music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, The
Culture Industry has been criticized as being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture.
Adarno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and
Adora, 2002, p. 101).
