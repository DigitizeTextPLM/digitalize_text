The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the direct effects and limited eects
media models, Theorists such as Ellul tendecl to side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
propaganda could directly influence the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, theorists such ae Lippriann
also noted that the media might not be influencing only thought, but may also be influencing what
people thought about. It was this line of thinking that restalted! et a starting point for future research
in the area of the limited effects of the media Such limited effects were shown through the work of
Iyengar and Kinder, ag well as MoCombe and Shaw. Overall, thie research of the scholars discussed 2

aa he formation of public opinion, While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul
ae formed years ago, they continue to help us understand the saciety that surrounds us today.
