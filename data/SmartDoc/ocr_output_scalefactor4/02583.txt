were published without their permission in 1949, Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing

themselves from their own work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the late
1940s the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises in 1951. Horkhetmer
became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954 Adorno published an essay
entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of a study that had been done for the
Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner and others. In this essay Adorno
warned, rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed
of psychological control (Adorno, 2001a, p. 160), It was one of the few occasions in the 19s
that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture, At least one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorst of his day did not take part in cultural developments
of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191), Adorno would nonetheless on cecasion attempt to reshape
his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal paeudo-culture

in the United States (Adorno, 1903, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1962 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film,

Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to
the culture industry, within the context of modernist (Hohendabl, 195, p. 131).

9 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

â€˜larense put an analysis of lane capitalist society inbo a syshematic context, as opposed bo
other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social conteol mechanistos in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual inte mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent [Alway, [Hh5, p. aa). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were te
maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.
Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects

of mut media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions
(Marcuse, 101, p. 8), However, it is difficult in Marcuses arguinent to separate culture
or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did mot distinguish culture or mass
media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno
had done. In the end Marcuses analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant
ideology. Marcuse wrote, "how can the adwolnistened individualewhe have made their muotilation
inte their own Lbertie: and sntisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged scaleliberate
themsebres from themselves ac well as from their masters? How is it even thinkable that the
viclews circle be broken? {Marcuss, 1990, p. 281). Given the pessimistic tone of the book,

it is somewhat ironie that largely because of it he would be perceived as an icon for leftist
movements of the 19006 in the US. and Germany that developed an oppositional stance.

Tn spite of this, Marcuse maintained that he was 4 philosopher, and not an activist, Like others
associated with the Frankfurt School, be was wary of the idea that theary could be translated

inte praction (Chambers, 2004, p. 226).

In reviewing the text in 1961, Priedrich Pollack reported to Acdorne and Horkheimer that the

work required too much revision to recelve mass dissemination. The two authors continwed ta
negotiate with the Fischer publishing house ancl 1966, and may bave anly agreed to republish

the work sinee pirate copies had already been disseminated by individual.
