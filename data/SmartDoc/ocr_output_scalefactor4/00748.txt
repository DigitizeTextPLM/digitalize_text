I8 & Very important factor, According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption, Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables
that influence how and why users and audience adopt a new information medium, such as the Internet
According to evolution of media technology, interpersonal infiuences are important ever though in the
past the individual is usually the unit of analysis, Alsa, critical mass becomes an important factor in
adopting new media because new media are interactive tools and thus are required Inv mary users to
gain efficiency. That is, the more people use, the mare people get benefits. Jn this sense, alffesion
theary not only can apply to practical things, but also can be related to digital divide.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
“/1) Innovators (venturesomeé), (2) Ea rly Adopters (respectable), i) Early Majority ( aelibarate (4
