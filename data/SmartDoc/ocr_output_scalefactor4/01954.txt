1. GENESIS OF "THE CULTURE INDUSTRY"

1 Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry as well as its reception the concept can be

examined chronologically, from its pre-conditions, through its generation, to its subsequent impact The idea of
mechanical re-

the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, is developed through insights into the

production of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music, but also to Hollywood

movies. That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies.

Adoma was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin
never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adomo
became in effect Benjamins only pupil. After Benjamin's death “it was Adorno who then introduced a rational-
‘zed version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (Jager, 2004, p. 65-6), The relationship with Benjamin had

an impact on the development of Adornos thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began
teaching at the Institute, Adomo lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi
party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began

operating there. The Nazis rise to power not only mearit that Adomo lost his job and would eventually force his

departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought, As Jiirgen Habermas would later note, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe-
riences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production

of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48).
Adorno was at Oxford from 1934 to 1938, where he wor
an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frank-
furt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the late
1930s Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “Qn the Fetish
Character in Music and the Repression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1990, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adome lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the:
original, and Adoma was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile miliew
impossible” (Adorno, Z001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regardest the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adomo, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from. the top-the original or Idea- to down of layers of imitations; to Adama, mass
tion was nothing, but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Fronkfurt school
was that of Adomo. In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had sacceeding in establishing a relationship for the
Tnstitute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in
Hew Work, obtained a position for Aderne at the Princeton Radio Research Project, rum by Paul Lazars-
felal. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although he later claimed that be did not know what a “radio project” was. For his part,
Lararsteld looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be an expert on music. Adomea
