1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the tite of interpersonal communication Initially focused on eee
social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, pre iarers L
ance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social peycho der
played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such ee esuuESE Ie 3
Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm af social interaction,
relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars
as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. Charing the Jater part of the decade
and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger became
along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson.
Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal comm research
agenda during the past two decades" (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus
on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communicati jon as
a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically
focuses on the development, maintenance, and disselution of relationships. It has been recognized
that interpersonal communication Is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).
Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has
comtributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus
en those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work
is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our
tnderstanding of interpersonal processes.

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of commu-
nication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has heen defined
and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there
was @ high amount of possible altematives and the probability of their event was relatively equal,
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
also contributed to the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the
information theorists as well as Heider (1954) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty tw fit interpersonal communication by defining uncetta inty as
the “number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave” {p. 100). The greater the
level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to pre-
dict behaviors and occurrences. During interactions individuals are not only faced with problems af
predicting present ard past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the wa
that they do. Berger and Bradac’s (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the compl i
process when they stated: “Uncertainty, 7 pee eter ts
