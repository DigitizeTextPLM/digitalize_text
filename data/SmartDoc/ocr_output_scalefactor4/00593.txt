Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized a5 a major field of study that has
contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to tocus

is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our

understanding of interpersonal processes.

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has heen identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of commu-
nication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined
and studied, One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there
was 4 high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal.
Shannon amd Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
alsa contributed to the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts fram the
information theorists as well as Heider (1958) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as
the “number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 100). The preater the
level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able
dict behaviors and occurrences. During interactions individuals are not only faced with
predicting present and past behaviors, but also ex plaining i

to pre-
problems of

why partners behave or believe in the way

that they do. Berger and Bradac’s (1982) definition of uncert ainty highlighted the complexity of this
process when they stated: “Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things
that a stranger can believe or potentially say" Uncertainty plays a sipnificant role when examinin

relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relat ional development Uncertaint a
