1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the firel real appearance of the idea of the
culture industry outside of a German cortex. In the years since there have bean numer-
ous crilieens of the text, rol least since Adema made sweeping generalizations about “the
commadified and fetishized character of all cultural goede” (Cocm, 1998, p. 773). Por the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Ademe erred i not discussing the processes of cul-
tural producton, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, be-
heving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip ofan all- pervasive reification” (Eagleton,
4551, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominanl values and belers
among oppressed peoples in society has some pari to play in the rapeoduction of the sys-
jem as a whole” (Eaginton, 1961, p. 38). Frednic Jameson pointed oul fiat Adannoa’s idea
of a quiture industry was historically irniled, since the society frat developed in the 1550s
and 1970s with new media want beyord the cullural possibilities available during the 712006.
While the idea of the culbure indusiry can be defended a6 a upeful theory for industnal soci-
@lies between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectweneas (Hohendaril,
1994, p. 146-48). Thus, for a some critics, Ine walue ofthe dea of the culture indusiry would

Thus forsoene critics modemist wares would be counteracting loroes against the domenant
ideology. As noted in the example af Creon Welles, however, fl may be the cage that the
dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for ®s own enda. The idea of the cufure
