Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a basic human fimetion in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Umcer-
fainty Reduction theory (URT), accredited to Charles B. Berger and Richard J, Calabrese (1975), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars
ioneered the Held of interpersonal communication by txarining this significant relationship in umbertainty
research. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 153). The study af information is basic
to all fields of comemunlestion, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the role of communication inte the central
focus which wes a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted eenpirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological thetries a5 staring points” tp ao,
‘The research underlying the theory and efforts made by ather contemporaries marked the emergence af inter-
personal communication research; with the development of URT, communication researchers began to look ta
communication for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social
sciences.
