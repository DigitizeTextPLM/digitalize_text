Like many other siructuralist scholars Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural linguistics
Ta SaUSSUTe, the linguistic mechanism operates an two levels, the systematic system and the variation
by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole Langue is the syétematined set
of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which compose
I as opposed to it, Speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language" (Barthes, 1987
p. 713}. Ba thes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level,
langue, is the social convention or value shared thro ugh a society which is stabilized and standardized
On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However,

it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the
shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values, It is the social part of
language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one
wishes fo communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization, The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that it comesponds to and individual act and not to a pure
éraation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system inte two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form
The form is called the signifier, which ts the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, bacomes the signified. “| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them fram each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959, in FR. Innis
(ed.), p. 37). The correspondence of the concept/meaning to the external form is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation but the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that "language does
not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from

within itself through a series of canceptual and phonic differences’. Acconding to Saussure, “meaning

is produced through a process of selection and combination of Sign s along two axes, the syntagmatic
(e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (¢.9., synonyms), organized into a signifying system” (Barker,
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the co nsensus of linguistic community
members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the follow-
ing sentence: “I went to a theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence is established through the
linear combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as | theater, my, and girifriend can be
substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as “She went to a restaurant with her mather.
Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated only when
they are related to each other. "Crucially, signs do not make sense by virtue of ete aaa entiies as
an independent object world; rather, they generale meaning by reference ta each other. d n alee
ing is understood as a social convention organized through the relations between signs ( nh OF, b.,
2002, p. 29). “It is central to Saussures argument that rad is meaningful in relation be saints
between red, green, amber, etc, These signs are then organized into eens. en g
meaning through the cultural conventions of their usage within a pariicular ¢
