4 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language jranslation marked the first real appearance of the idea of fe
culture industry outside of a German content. In the years since there have Deen Mumes:
sus cricamns of the text, nal least since tdemo made sweeping generalizations alyourt “the
eammodified and fetishined character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adorno erred in mat discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and failed 10 examine ihe culture industry's ecanomic dependence oe canes
business sectors, including marketing ang advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adarna and Marcuse everestimated the damimant ideology, be-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-penaaee ion”
4991, p. 48). Still, Eagleton conceded mat “ine diffusion of dominant values and benlie bs
among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduchon of the sy8-
jem as a whole” (Eagiton, 1891. p. 46). Fredric Jameson poe
ef a cumure indusiry was hisboricallty lirrabed, sarice the eocucty
and 1970s with raw media went beyond the culhural possibilities available dunng the 1540s.
hile the idea of the culture indusiry can be defended as 8 useful theary for industrial soct
clies babween 1820 and 4970, tring 10 use it oday weakens its effect
1605, p. 146-48). Thus, tor a some critics, the value of tne idea of the quiture industry would
so pear to be menchy historical, if thery in faet conceded that it had any value at all.

Thus for some ctilics modernisl works would be counteracting forces against the dominant
iddealogy. Ags mated in the example of Orson VWehes, however, tmay be the case tha the
