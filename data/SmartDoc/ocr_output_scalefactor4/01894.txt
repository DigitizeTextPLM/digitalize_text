CONCLUSION; THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing
public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase
the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more
than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity and
propaganda |Bernays, 1955, p.22). Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent a different view of
the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily
mnanipulated, Bermays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which

1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of th
