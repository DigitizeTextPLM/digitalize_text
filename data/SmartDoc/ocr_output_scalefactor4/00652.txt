act ognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT} attempted to
explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual, Lewin foreshadowed CDT
Ti his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). CDT allows for three
relationships to occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equi
librium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each
other; and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions im question have no effect on one another
(West & Turner, 2000), Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of arousal and dis-
comfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to
feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual
usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to the self. This need for social comparison can
result in conformity pressures (Trenholm d& Jensen, 2004). Berger and Calabrese (197%) related so-
cial comparison to URT by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons seek out similar others
who are proximate when they experience a high level of uncert ainty regarding the appropriateness of
their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation” (p. 107), Festinger received the Distinguished
Scientist award of the American Psychological Assovialion and the Distinguished Senior Scientist
Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger's legacy is significant, and
tical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research. Aronson (in
era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of
social psychology has not been the same since” (p. 3).
