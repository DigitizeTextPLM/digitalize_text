i. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATION

Five basic assumpcions were stated lina stuck of Kat, Bumler, and Garevitch in 1974.25 follows.
‘They provide a framework for anderstanding the correlation between media and audiences:

1. The audience is conceived as active, ie, an important par of of mass media use is
assumed to be goal oriented ... patterns of media wee are shaped by more cer less
definite expectations of whal certain kinds of content have to offer the audience
Oeemiteer.

— Inthe mass communication process much inidative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with ibe audience member. This places a strong limitation on
theorizing atout any foem of straight-line effect of media content on altitudes and
behavior.

. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
Mass Communication consti¢uie bul a segment of the wider range of human meets,
and the degree to which they can be adequarely met chrowgh mass media consamp-
lion certainly varees.

. Miethedologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use cam be derived
from deta supplied by individual audience members themselves: ie, people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests amid motives iin

particular cass, an at beast te recognize them when combronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulacion.

In addition, Karz, Blumler, and Gurevich also commenced chat, alchough previcas researches on
graitfications detected diverse gratifications that attract people on the media, they did not address the
Comme clioes between these pralifications (Ratt ef al, 1974), They suggested thar uses and gretifi-

Tommeguences, perhaps mostly unineended ones” (RKacz etal, 19746, p. 20) The smodies of Kare and
his calleagaes laid a theoretecal foundation of building the uses and gratifications approach. Since
then, the research on this subjes hes been srreeqgghesed and extended. The cares! dlatus of uses and
gratifications is still based om Katz's first analysis, partioglarly as new media forms have emenged lin

1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach emphasines motives and the sell-perceived needs of audience mem-
bers. Blumer and Kare (1974) conchoded that different people can ose the same communication mes-
sake for very differeme purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs bor different
