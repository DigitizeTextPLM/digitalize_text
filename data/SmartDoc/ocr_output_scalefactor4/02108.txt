1, THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in
Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlati ve
in Europe. The closest thing in Adornos experience to the advertising industry in the United States
was fascist propaganda (Jager. 2004, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience with
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda (Horkhelmer and Adorno, 2002. p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarafeld and Adorno clic
not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adornos dissatisfaction with
the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop
the idea of the culture industry.

Because of the relationship between the Inatitute for Social Research and Columbia University,
Horkheimer, mo kad already mowed to California, could not bring Adarno to the West Coast until
November 1942. When Adorie was finally able ta relocate, he joined an arpatriate community that
included Frits Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hana Eisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Déblin, and
Bertolt Brecht, several af which found work in the Hollywood movie iidtsiny. The fact that Adorno
