rates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation
d the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set
of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal el ted
it ag opposed to it, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language (Barthes, pei
o.13). Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimension. The peace! ; 7
lanque, is the sockal convention of value shared through a society which is stabilized and sta ized.
On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. es!
it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the
shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values, Itis the sacial part of
language, {tis essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one
wishes to communicate. It is because a lanquage is a systern of contractual values that if
resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social insti-
tution, In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that it comesponds to and individual act and not to a pure
cretion. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the fonm.
The fonm is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dag in English or in Korean are the extemal forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, tne concept in question, becomes the signified. "| propose to retain the ward sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace Concept and sound-image respectively by signited (signifi) and
signitier (significant); the last two tenms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from @ach other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis

(@d.), p. 37). The correspondence of the conceptimesning to the external form is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. itis not the inevitable intemal relation but the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that “language doas:
not reflect a pre-axistent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from
within itself through @ series of conceptual and phonic differences". According to Saussure, “meaning
is produced through @ process of selection and combination of signs alang two axes, the
(eg. @ sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g. synonyms), organized inte a signifying system” (Barker,
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signa or the underlying systematic order, the ayntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. Foran example of the ayntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the fallew-
ing Sentence: “I went to @ theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence is established th h the
linear combination of signs. The signe within the example, such as | theater, my, and onittanctes
