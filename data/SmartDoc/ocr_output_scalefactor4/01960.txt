1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culture industry Sutsige of a German context, In the years anh ose have been numer-
ous criticisms of the text, not least since Adorno made Sweeping generalizations about “the
commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 71996, Pp. 173). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adormo erred in not discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and failed to examine the culture |

ndustry’s economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Ademo and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, be-

lleving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton,
1991, p. 48). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs

among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys-
fem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 38). Fredric Jameson painted out that Adorna’s idea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society thal developed in the 1960s.
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1940s.
While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial saci-
eties between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hahendahl,
1995. p. 146-48). Thus, fora some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry would
appear to be merely histancal, if they in fact conceded that it had any value at all. ;
Thus for same critics mademnist works would be counteracting forces against the dominant
ideology. As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may ba the case ine
dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of the cu te
industry has had an importance in critical theory since its appearance in the: 1940s, in tha
