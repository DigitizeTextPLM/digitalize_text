Like many other structuralist acholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural linguistics.

To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on twa levels, the systematic system and the varkation
tee angue is the systematized set

by speaking actors. The formar is called langue and the latter parole. L

p.13), Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic systam within the social dimension. The structure level,

langue, is the social convention orvalue shared through a society which ig slabilized and standardized.

A language is therefore, -@ social Institution and a sysbem of values. Ibis the social part of
language, itis essentially a cobective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one
wishes to communicate. [tis because & language is 4 system of contractual values that it

resiats the modifications coming from a singe individual and is consequently @ social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, whieh is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization, The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view fo expressing his parsonal theught. It is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual act and not to a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 141 54

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language sysiem inte to parts, the

signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English ar in Korean are ihe external forma expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the aiqnified. “| propose fo retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and fo replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifi d
t the whole sig (signifié) an
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that seps-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959, in R. bir
{ed.), p. 37). The correspondence of the conceptimeaning to the external ferm is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation but the difference
between the signa that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1950) argues that “language does
not reflact a pre-exisiant and extemal reality of independent objects, but consinacts meaning from
wathin itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences”, According to Saussure, "meanin
is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the paced
