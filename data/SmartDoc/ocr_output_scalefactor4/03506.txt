Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes wae influenced by Saussure structural linguistics.
To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systamatic system and the variation
by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole, Langue is the systematized set
of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which compose
it; as opposed to it, speech (parcle) is covers the purely individual part of language” (Barthes, 1967,
p.13). Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level,
langue, is the social convention or value shared through a seciety which is stabilized and standardized.
On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level, However,
itis considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from tee
shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of
language, itis essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entinaty if ome
wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming fram a single individual and is consequently & social inst-
tution, In contrast to language, which is both instrution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that it comesponds to and individual act and mot to a pure
creation, (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the

signified and the signifier. The signified is 4 concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.
The form iS called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the extemal forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
aninmal, the concept in question, becomes the signifiad. "| propose to retain ihe word sign (signe) te
designate the whole and to replace concept and eound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advaniage of indicating the opposition thal sepa-
fates them fromm each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis
fed.), p. 37). The correspondence of the conceptimeaning to the extemal form is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation but the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying system, Saussure (1950) argues that “language dors
not reflect a pre-existent and extemal reality of independent objects, but consiructs meaning from
within itself through 2 series of conceptual and phonic differences". According to Saussure, “meaning
is produced through & process of selection and combination of signs along two ames, the syntageiatic
fe.9. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (6.g., synonyms), organized Into a signifying system” (Barker,
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection ls also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members, For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the follow-
ing sentence: “l went to a theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence is established through the
linear combination of signs, The signs within the example, such as | theater, my, and girlfriend can be
substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as "She went to a restaurant wih er mother.”
Threugh the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated only when
they are related to ach other. “Cructally, signe do not make sense by virtue of reference to entities in
an independent abject world; rather, they generate meaning by reference to each other. Thus, mean-
ing is understood a% a social convention arganized through the relations between signs* (Barker, C..
2002, p. 29). “Itis central to Saussures argument that red is meaningful in relation to the difference
between red, green, amber, etc. These signs are then onganized into a sequence which generates
meaning through the cultural conventions of their usage within @ particular context.
