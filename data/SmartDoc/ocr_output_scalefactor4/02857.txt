1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother te present itself as art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkbeimer and Acharne, 2002, p. 05). This business was based on what Adorno referred bo as Fordast
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques: used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tembencies were based on centralization and hierarchy ([Hohendahl,
1995, p 142). Examples of thienot specified by Adeormowere the Hollywood production syetem, or
the CBS radio network that bad been asociated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
2102, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the syetesn,
and that nothing trily adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, Pp.
MGT). Paradoxically, any innavation would only reaffirm the system, and Aderne cited Oreon Welles
as an example of somecne who was allowed to break the roles, The elasticity in the system would
allow it t0 asiume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual
(Friedman, 1981, p. 185). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrament
