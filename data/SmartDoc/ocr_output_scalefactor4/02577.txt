studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specitic content or by the medium
itself (Katz et al, 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice,
support, or occasions for emotional release [Hermog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared toples
of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, asychotogist Herzog (144) marked them with the term “gratifications.” -

Lises and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications regearch, Elihu Katz is ane of the most well-known
and contributed greatly ta establishing the Structure of the approach.

Elthu Kate is served both as a sociolagist and a4 a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in So~
ciology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government of israel, Katz headed the task force charged
vith the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led te his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in lelgure, culture and communication fram the 1970s tol$40s (UPENN, 2001). In
7993, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Penngylhania, and also directed Its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Kate's mentor in Columbia University ls Paul Lazarsfeld, who 6 one of the pioneers of gratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theary model. Later, Katz infraduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
notion that people use the media to their benefit. Ina study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject
which is known as the uses and gratifications research were explored. They viewed the mass media asa means
by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to
their needs mare readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973),

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumier, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 which
were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication. They took a more humanistic chtal

approach to looking at media

use. They suggest that media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills the
they have alternate choices i needs of the user and
ey e to satisfy their need. [Blumer & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that wade
