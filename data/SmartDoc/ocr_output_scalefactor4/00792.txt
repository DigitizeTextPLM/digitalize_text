Rogers was born in Carroll, Iowa in 1931. He eamed his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from lowa
State University, For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Fore. Interestingly.
in 1966, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea. rie

The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creats applications of diffu-
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political SrIenIOe, and, as previously
mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was

suffering from kidney disease, He died on October 21, 2005. ; ce
According to Rogers (146), diffusion refers to “the provess by which an innovation is comm i=
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption, The diffu-
sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication of mass commu-
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, $-M-C-R-E
(e.g. sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this S-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, “Time’ variable

the innowation-decision process; (2) inmowativencss; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption, Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research hes attempted to explain the variables

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovetiveness:
‘UU Innowators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate 4, (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional}” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p, 40). Figure | shows the relationships between types
