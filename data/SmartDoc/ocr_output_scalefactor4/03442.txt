Uses and Gratifications

1.1. Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential traditian in media reasearch. The original
conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of
cerain media contents. The care question of such research is: Why do people use media
and Whal do they use them for? (McQuail, 1983). There exists a basic idea in this approach:
audience members know media content, and which media they can use to meet their needs.
in the mass communication process, uses and gratifications approach puts the functlan of
linking Meed gratifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience members. It
suggests that people's needs influence what media they would choose, how they use cer-

tain media and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs from other
theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active me
