According to Rogers (1995), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation Is commu-
nicaled through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An In novation
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption, The diffu-
sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commiu-
nication people can gel information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful, Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-C-R-E

[e.g.. semdcr-message-chunnel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this $-M-C-R-E commu-
Mication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19%, Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors of opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal of mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social syalem, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, “Time” variable
