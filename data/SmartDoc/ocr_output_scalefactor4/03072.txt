THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far bevond anything he had seen in
Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative
in Europe. The closest thing in Adornos experience to the advertising industry in the United States
was fascist propaganda (Jager, 2004, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience with
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
nropaganda (Horkhelmer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that L vzarateld and Adorno did
not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adornos dissatisfaction with
the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop
the idea of the culture industry

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adormo, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead
a business, amd this in turn became an ideclogy bo legitimize the trash they intentionally produce

m

(Horkheimer and Aderne, 2002, p. $5). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist

capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in

the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy [Hohendahl
1995, p. 142). Examples of tl Cb Spee liv Adornowere the Hollywood production system, or
the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work [Horkheimer and Adorno,
2002, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p.
106-7). Paradocica Ly innovation would only reaffirm the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles

1 example of someone who was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would
allow it to assume the etance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual
(Friedman, 1981. p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry wae an instrument
of social control [Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of economic
ecencion ultimately meant the freedom to be the same (Horkhelmer and Adome, 2002. p. 136)

Since Adorno had been, in his essays on mitsic and radio, an apparent defender of high art

Culture Industry has been criticized as being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture

Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and
Adorno, 2002, p. 101), It was not high art that Adorno was presenting as an alternative to the culture
industry, but modernism. Although he provides the idea of an opposing foree to the culture industry.
