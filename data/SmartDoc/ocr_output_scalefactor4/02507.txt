Dhese preconditions Adormos interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his ate on the
Princeton Fiadio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in (California and the
relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important to an understanding of
his concern for the idea of the culture industry )

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itselfas art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 5). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordést
eanitalism, in which mass production hased on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insotar a5 these temlencies were based on ¢ sntralization and hierarchy {Hohendahl
1995, p. 142) Examples of thisnot specified by Adormmowere the Holhewend production system, of
the CBS radio net work that had been asso inated with the Prmceton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplant the work [Horkheimer and Adorno
