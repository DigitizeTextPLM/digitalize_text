nulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
henefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them

the public is still possibie, 1! is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. J heorists such as

Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point
