‘This method of coment asalysis is ted strongly to Laeswell (1563) carly definition al communication which

nemtainier of his career

Aside from Understanding the contend of propaganda, Lasswell was alan indeneded in how peopapands could
shape publicopinion. This deall primarily with understanding the effects of die media, Laswell war particularly
interested in cxaminieg the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a dimnocratic system, be the
way, Lasswell has created a cpcie, whereby the public is limined im the information thal is presented in chem,

LZ Exbward Bernays (1891-1995)

AL appeccimanely the same cme that Lappmunn ard Laswell were examining puolic opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bemays (1891-1955) was examining, public relatiees, propaganda, and public opinion. Berrays (1920)
defines propaganila as, a conisnern. enduring effort in # or shape evens to infloemce the relations of a
public to an enterpree, Kea, or group (fp. 25) Contra other propagedida chieorisis, Bernas recognizes
that propaganda can be exher beneficial ar harmful w che public, [i can hele duals, decide what io chink

” Based on these ideas chat ihe public opinion can be modified, and that wack shaping is a necessary part of
society, Bersays purwed his work in the field of poblic relations. “Public relaons is the amengt, by information,
