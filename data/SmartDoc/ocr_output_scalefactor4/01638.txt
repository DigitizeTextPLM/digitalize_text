According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an inmcvation is commu-
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system, An Inmowation
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffa-
sicm af innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communkation ar mass commu-
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation 2s useful. Lasswell
(1945) presented a well-known eedel of communication that is analyzed as five parts, §-M-C-R-E
(e.g. sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers | 1995) mentioned, “this 5-M-C-R-E corme-
nication model corresponds chisely to the elements ef diffusion” (p. U9). Specifically, (1) sender

ean be inventors of opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
inlerpersonal or reese communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. in the diffusioe theory, “Time” variable
