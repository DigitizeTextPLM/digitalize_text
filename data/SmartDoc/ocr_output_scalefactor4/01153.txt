tionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional theory
on communication agrees with media's effects towards people. For example, a model often used in the the-
ory, the Hypadermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential

effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information into the consciousness of the masses” (Watson & Mill 1997, p.

105), Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1940s. After that, a shift

which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to astablishment of uses

and gratifications approach,

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as
empirical mass communication research itself [McOQuail, 1983). Dating back to the 1540s, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well
at dath) newspaper [Lagrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warmer & Henry, 1948; ete). lin these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content of by the medium
itself (Katz et al, 174b), For instance, radio soap operas were found to satiety their lgteners with advice,
support, or occasions far emotional release (Herrog, 1944: Warner and Henry, 148); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics

of conversation and a structure te the daily routine (Berean, 2949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog |1944) marked them with the tenm “gratifications.”

Uses and grattications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
Up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed whan it was rediscovered during that ara, Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Kats is one of the most well-known
and contriguted greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and a3 & communication researcher Me recehed his Ph.D. in Sa-
ciplogy in 1956 from Columbbla University and began teaching at the University of Chirage until 1963, During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrow Univer:
sity of Jerusalem. in the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and teleweion in leisure, culture and communication from the 1570s tols9os (UPEMN, 2004), In
