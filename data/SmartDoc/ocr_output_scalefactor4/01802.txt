sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously

| According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu-
) nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
| sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 40).
| That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu-
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-C-R-E
| (e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-eftect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this $-M-C-R-E commu-
| nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (jp. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can he inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
| interpersonal or mass cotnmunication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theary, “Time” variable
| ig a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is invelved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rite of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted fo explain the variables

theery not only cant apply te practical frimgs, but also can be related fo digital diviee.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
C1) Innovators (venturesome}, (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (3) Laggards (traditionaly” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
mnembers of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure | shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by jnnovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories

adoption is faster than that of the hybrid seed com) can have their own different rates in diffusion. Fig-
