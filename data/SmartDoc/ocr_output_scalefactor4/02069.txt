Uses and Gratifications

4.1 Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media research. The original
conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of
certain media contents. The care question of such research is: Why do people use media
and what de they use them for? (McQuail, 1993). There exists a basic idea in this approach:
audience members know media content, and which media they can use to meet their needs.
In the mass communication process, uses and gratifications approach puts the function of
linking need gratifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience members. It
suggests that people's needs influence what media they would choose, how they use cer-
tain media and what gratificatians the media give them. This approach differs from other

theoretical perspectives in thal it regards audiences as active media users as opposed to
passive receivers of information. In contrast to traditional media effects thearies which focus
on “what media do to people” and assume audiences are homogeneous, uses and gratifica-
tions approach is more concerned with “what people do with media” (Katz, 1953). It allows
audiences personal needs to use media and responds to the media, which determined by
their social and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach alse postulates
that the media compete with ather information sources for audience's need satisfaction (Katz
etal, 1874a). As traditional mass media and new media continue to provide people with a
vide range of media platforms and content, itis considered one of the most appropriate
perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be exposed to different.

The approach emphasizes audiences’ choice by assessing their reasons for using
acertain media to the disregard of others, a5 well as the various gratifications obtained
from the media, based on individual social and psychological requirements (Severin
& Tankard, 1997). As 4 broader perspective among communication researches, it pro-
vides a framework for understanding the processes by which media participants seek
information or content selectively, commensurate with their needs and interests (Katz
etal, 1974a). Audience members then incorporate the content to fulfill thelr needs or
to satisfy their interests fLowery & Nabila, 1953).

4.2 Origin and History

itis well accepted that communication theories have developed through the realms of psy-
chology and sociology over the past 100 years. With illumed by valuable ideas as well as
exploging more untilled fields in these two disciplines, researchers elicil a series of higher
conceptions of understanding media.
