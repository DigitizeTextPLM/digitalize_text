1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratitications aparoach emphasizes motives and the self-percenved needs of audience mem:
bers. Gluenler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication mes-
sage for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different
individuals. There is not only one way that people uses media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons
for using the media aa there are media users (Bbumiler & Rate, 1974),

Basic needs, social stuation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and
education, athect peaple’s ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their
reeds, That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motwes and grabfications
for using diferent media. MMcChuail, Bumier, and Brown [1972] proposed a model of “media-persan
interactions’ to classify four enpaortant media gratifications: (1) Gewerson: escape from routine or
proolems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companaanship, social utility: (3) Personal
identity: self reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Survedlance (fons of informa:
ton seeking).

Anoilher subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by MoGuire (1974), based
On 4 general Theory of burman needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitee ard

aMective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus
“internal goal orientation, avd ematian stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types ed motivations which apoly to media use [Figure 1). Faure 1. A
structuring of 16 general paracigens of human motvation (Moguine, 1974), Kats, Gurevitch and Haas
(1973) develoged 35 needs taken from the social and prychological functions of the mass media and
