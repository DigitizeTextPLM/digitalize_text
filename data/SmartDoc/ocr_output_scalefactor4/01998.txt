ar impact on the development of Adornos thought during this period, Returning to Frankfurt, Adomo began
teaching at the Institute. Adem lost his right te teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi
party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch ef the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began
operating there. The Maris rise to power notonky meant that Adorno lost his job and would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jtrzen Habermas would later note, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe-
nences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48).

i Already in the late
1990s Adome evidenced litthe hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1990s, Benjamin and Adomo debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “Cm the Fetish
(Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adomo lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records, The result was inferior to the

wction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adamo, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adorno, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea- to down of layers of imitations; to Adorno, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adomo. In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the

Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continae working in

New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, run by Paol Lazars-

feld. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted

the position, although he later claimed that he did not know what a “radio project” was. For his part,

Lazarsfeld looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be an expert on music. Adora

wrote for the Project’s journal in 1941, reite ating his position thal radio was only an mage of a live perior-

mance. In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio indu stry that the medium was bir ci lenin music
