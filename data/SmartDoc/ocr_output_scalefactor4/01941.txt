Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system ints twa i
signified and the signifier. The signified ls a concept or meaning which pene aee pede eb
The form is called the signifier, which is the extemal part of language, For example, beth the word
deg in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. “| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifier (significant); the last two terns have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959, in R, innis
(ed). 6. 37). The correspondence of the concept/meaning to the extemal farm is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation, Wis ned the inevitable inbenial relation but the difference:

between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1980) argues that “language does
not reflect a preexistent and extemal reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from
within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences". According to Saussure, "meaning
ig produced through @ process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic
(e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (eg.. synonyms), organized inion a signifying system” (Barker,
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the follow.
