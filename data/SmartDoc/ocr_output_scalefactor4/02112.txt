the formation of public sheen In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being eanlly
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this, He claims, The public ts not ar amorphous mass which
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea

benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, ] ublic relations is Important because it helps th

the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul tended to cdisapres with this point.
