1 Early Influences

The follerving theorists significantly contributed to the examinabion of uncertainty in communication.
The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger amd Calabrese (1975),

Li Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Lowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,
one of the Founders of social paychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a sub-
#lantial influence an the development of interpersonal communscation. After graduation, initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but im 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Inati-
tate of Technology and the Research Center for Group Demamies. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the Mew School for Social Research
(Samelson, 2M). Much of Festinger's research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential an the emerging field of in-
terpersonal communication and on the development af LRT. Festinger © bes! knonen for the theres
of Cognitive Dissonance and Soctal Comparison. Copnilive Disonance theory (COT) atlempiad Ww
explain here an imbalance among cepnilioss machi allect an tadividual. Lewin foreshadowed COT
in his gherrvations regarding altitude change in small groups (Festinger, (9&2). COT allows for three
rel@ionships to Occur among cognitions: a consonant relalionship, im which cognitions are im equi-
likeiam wiih each other; a dissonant relationship. in which cogaitions are im competichin with each
other: and an imrekevant pelabenship, in which the cognaions in question have mo effect on one another
(West & Tomer, 2000). Cognitne Dissonance, like uncemaieay, has an element of arcusal and dits-
comfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individeals look io
feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual
uiually seeks. the opinions of others whe are Genilar te the self. This need for socal eotparison Gan
result in conformity pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, 204), Heenger seed Calabrese (1975) related s-
ial comparison to LRT by stating that “Festinger has suggested ihat persons seek oun similar others
wht are prooumane when they cuperience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropraatenies at
thelr behavior and‘oe opinions ina panicular situation” (p. VOT) Festinger received the Dtstinguished
Sclemtist awand of the American Psychological Asunciatkee and che Distingmished Senior Scientist
Award from the Seciety of Expenomenial Social Psychology. Pesinger’s legacy is significant, and
his theoretical mfhwence can will be recognized in contemporary social science peeearch. Auronson (in
Feaiieger, 10) stated, “It was in this era that Leon Festinger invented amd developed his theory of
cognitive dissonance, and inmy opinion, social peycholey hard ned beer the same singe” Cp. 3).
