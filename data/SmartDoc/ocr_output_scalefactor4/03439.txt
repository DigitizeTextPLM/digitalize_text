Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grawn
Up. SOM basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Kate is one of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in So-
clology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he tau ght in the Department oF Sociology and Carnimunication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem, In the late 1950, invited by the Government of lsrael, Katz headed the task force charged
with the Introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s to Las (UPEM Al 2001), In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.
