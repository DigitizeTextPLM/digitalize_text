satisfaction, psychologist Herrog (1944) marked them with the term “gratiications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 19506 till 19705 when television has grown
Up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and pratitications research, Elihu Kate is ane of the most well-enown
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz if served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received he Ph.D. in So-
clology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Orpartment of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government of brael, Katz headed the task force charged
with the Intraduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 19705 015905 (PENN, 2001). bn
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its

imental Scholars program far post-doctoral study.
eee mentor in Calumbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, who is oneaf the pioneers of gratification reseanch.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratification: with the
functional theory model Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he smrene with the
notion that people use the media to their benefit, In a study by Kate, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject
