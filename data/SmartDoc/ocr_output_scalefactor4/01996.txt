According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu-
. 5 P I
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu-
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, $-M-C-R-E
(¢.g,, sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this §-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 15). Specifically, (1) sender

can be inventors or opinion leaders, (7) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels oe i
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social s¥ stem, and qr :
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusron theory, fsa etre
is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable 1s involved in diffusion in {
