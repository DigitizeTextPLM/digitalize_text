(148) presented a well-kreraes model of communicetion that is analyzed as five parts, §-M-C-H-E
(e.g. sender-mexsage-channel-receiver-ettect) Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this §-M-C-B-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. UH. Specifically, (1) senckt

‘There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according ta Innewativeness:
“{L) Innovators {verrturesume), (2) Early Adogiers (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Latte Majority (skeptical), and (3) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1994, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined
this berm as “the degree to whech an individeal 14 relatively earlier in adoptieg new ideas than other
