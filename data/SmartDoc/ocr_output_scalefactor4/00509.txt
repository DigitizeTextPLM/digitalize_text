4 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 Engliahanguage transtation marked the first real nage
culture industry outside of a German context in the years since there have ppt
cae critica of the text, not least since Adomo made swrepng generalizations about
eomencdified ard fetishized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adomo ered in not discussing the processes af cul-
tural production. and faihed to mcamine the culture industry's acomamic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and adverioing (Goce, 1996, p. 48). :

For Terry Eagleton, both Adome and Marcuse overestimabed tne dominard idealogy, be-
feving that “capitalst society languishes in the rip of an all-pervasive reificabon (Eagleton.
4991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
among oporessed peoples in society has some part to play in the meproducton of the sys-
tem as a whole” (Eagleton, 7891. p. 38), Fredric Jameson pointed aut that Acorna’s Kea
of a quiture industry was historically limited, since the society that develoged in the 1960s
and 19706 wath new media went beyond the cultural possibilities avalable during the 15405.
While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for induatinal sOci=
plies between 1820 and 1970, trying ta use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahil,

1995, p. 146-48). Thus, for a some critica, fhe value of the dea of the culiune industry would
appear io be merely hestoncal, i they in fact coneeded that it had any value at all

Thus lor some crifice modemist works would be counteracting lores agains! the dominant

dectogy Ad pated in the example of Orson Vielles, however, it may be the case that tne
dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for is own enda The idea of the culture
industry has had an importance in critical theory since ts appearance in the 1940s, in that
it has led fo Hough about the role of mage communications in rélatan to ideology, and
hence, pockhy. Since Adomea made sweeping genéralizalions about the impact of the culture
industry, and since he did nol systematically explore how the culture industry operated, = has
bean generally easy for some bo dismiss the dea of a cullure indushry. It monethnesege the

how mass communication media propagate dominant ideologies.
