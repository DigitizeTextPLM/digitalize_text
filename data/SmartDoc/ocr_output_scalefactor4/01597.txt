The exploration of pratifications that motivate people to be attra ched to certain media is almost a6 Old as

empirical mass communication research itself (McQuail, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers eae
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well
as dally newspaper {Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc.}. In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some sp ecific content or by the medium
itself [Katz et al., 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas Were found to satisfy their listeners with advice,
support, or occasions for emotional release (Her2og, 1944, Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, paychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were propos ed when it was rediscovered during that era, Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach,

Elihu Matz is served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in So-
ciology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. Im the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the Cc I of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
