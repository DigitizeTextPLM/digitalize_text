Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- ie., people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in
particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms. (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous researches on
pratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract peaple on the media, they did not address the
connections between these pratifications (Katz et al., 1974a). They suggested that uses and gratifi

needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) dif
