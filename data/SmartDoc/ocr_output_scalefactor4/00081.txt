Sinn emaye, 1955, p22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase,
e engineering of oonsent. He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning mare
than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit ar miss publiciey and
<eohameed (Bernays, 1955, p22). Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent. a different view of
formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public az being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1028, p. G6). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea
that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial. [t must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the
Public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept [p. 66).

Betnays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting ta
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as 8 tool that can be
weed to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The obbective-oinded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays,
1952, p. 9). Bernaye view of the public is softer than that af Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipalation of the public is possible. Bernaye (1052) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
bo understand the sacety of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, 10 evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to perauade or suggest courses of action (p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is stall possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance mf the public opinion, Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The thearies developed by Lippmann, Cossmell, Bile, and Hernays ure important for a nmimber of
reasons. Based on the ideas of hia predecessors, Lipprnann wes obte to bring affention to the fact dat
the public ia atte to be influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and his collenques has ded fo more

their audience,

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the direct effects and limited eects
media model, Theorists such as Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
propaganda could directly influence the thought of the masse. Meanwhile, theorists such ae Lippmann
also noted that the media might not be influencing only thought, bat may alao be infurncing what
people thought about. It was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting paint for future research
in the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited etferts were shown through the work of
[yengar and Kinder, as well as MeCiambe and Shaw. Crrerall, the research af the scholars disriassedd tn
this paper has been very important to the understanding of the media, the manipulation of the public,
and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasawell, Bernays, and Ellul
were formed years ago, they contanue ta help us understand the sockety that surrounds us today.
