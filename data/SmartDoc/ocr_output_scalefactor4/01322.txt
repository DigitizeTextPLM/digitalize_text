1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an imiportant construct, mecessary to the study of commu-
nication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and bow it has been defined
and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
a d ¥ is thr al inf
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a piven situation when there
was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was telatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of metsages, but their work
also contributed to the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the
information theorists as well as Heider (1958) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as
the “number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 100). The preater the
level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to pre-
dict behaviors and occurrences. During interactions individuals are not only faced with problems of
predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or belleve in the way
thar they do. Berger and Bradac's (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this
process when they stated: “Lincertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things
that a stranger can believe or potentially say” Uncertainty plays a significant role when examining
relationships, High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development. Uncertainty can
