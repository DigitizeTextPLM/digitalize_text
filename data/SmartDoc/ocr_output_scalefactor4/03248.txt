1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified 46 an important consinect, necessary to the study of comin
nication, in would be beneficial to know when the concept onginated, and hin i has been defined
and studied. One way to consider uncertainry is throwgh the theoretical framework od iefoemation
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1525) proposed that uncertainty existed ina given situation when ther
was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal
Shannan and Weaver related this werw of uncertainty be the mamsmission of messages, hur their work
