at Adomoa would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one
strange that the leading cultural theot ist of

observer found it
his day did not take part in cultural developments
Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape
his thought on the culture industry. For exatnple, in 1959 he wrote of a universal peeudo-culture

Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995. p. 141)
