party. Horkheimer had already set up branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began
operating there. The Nazis rise to power not only meant that Adorno last his job and would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jirgen Habermas would ater note, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe-
riences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 43).

Adomo was at Oxford from 1934 to 1938, where he worked ona manuscript on Husserl. He was considered
an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frank=
furt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the late
19306 Adomo evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adome lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed ina concert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was interior to the
original, and Adorno was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu

impossible” (Adomo, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adorno, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea- to down of layers of imitations; to Adorno, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
Was that of Ademo. In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in
New Vork, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, run by Paul Lazars-
feld. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, a
