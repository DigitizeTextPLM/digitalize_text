departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought As Jingen Habermas wauld later note, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe=
riences influencing the development of critical theary, the others being Stalinist repression and the production
of macs culture in the United States (Morris, 2011, p. 48).

Adorno was at Oxford from 1934 to 1938, where he worked on a manuscripton Husserl, He was considered
an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and be looked forward to joining his Frank-
furt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meamtime moved to the United States. Already in the late
1930s Adomo evidenced litte hope for mass culture. As propaganda ond estertainment increased during the

1930s, Benjamin and Adoma debated mass culture, since film and radic became the twa most popular means

to disseminate propaganda under the fascist ane! Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translared as “On the Fetish

Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Act in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. S2). A pri-
mary problem for Adorney lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a comees: hall, symphonic works cul
now be heard aver the radia, and cauld be reproduced on phonograph, records. The result wai Inferior to the
original, and Ademo was emphatic in his condenination of the mechanical reproduction of music: Together
with sport and fil, mass music and the new listening help ta make escape from the whole infantile milieu
