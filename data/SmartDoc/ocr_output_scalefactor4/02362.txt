(S) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time* variable

is a very important factor, According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in {hy

decording to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are iportant even hone in the

adopting new media because new media are interactive tools and thus are required by mary wEers 10

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
“(1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185), Rogers detined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure | shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories

I. Knowledge + or — (selective exposure of awareness af news)

9. Attitudes + or — (people have positive or negative attitude toward innovations)

3. Adoption (Decision): people decide to adopt the innovation
