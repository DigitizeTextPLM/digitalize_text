Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural linguistics.
To Sauesure, the linguistic mechanism operates. on two levels, the systematic system and the variation
by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue ie the systematized set
of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which compose
it as opposed to it, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language" (Barthes, 1257,
p.13), Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimansian. The structure level,
langue, isthe social convention orvalue shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized.
On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However,
itis considered relatively flaxible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the
shared convention, the structure.

A language la therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of
language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one
wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it
regists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social insti-
tution, In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an indivadual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view te expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is
essentially 2 combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual act and mol to a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system inte hwo parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the fonm.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. “| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifie) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the sdvantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-

rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts’ (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis

(ed.), p. 37). The correspondence of the conceptimeaning to the external form is net in the destined

relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation, It is not the inevitable infernal relation but the difference

between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (7960) argues that “language dows

not reflact a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from

within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences”. According to Saussure, "meaning

is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along fwo axes, the syntagmeatic
fe.g. a sentence} and the paradigmatic (e.g. synonyms), organized into a signifying system” (Barker,

2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs of the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another, Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members, For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the follow-
ing sentence: "I went to a theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence is established through thee
linear combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as | theater, my, and girlfriend can be
substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as "She went to a restaurant with her rreatiaer.”
Through the syntagmatec and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated onhy when
they are related to each other. "Crucially, signs do not make sense by virlue of reference to entities. in
an independent object world; rather, thay generate meaning by reference to seach other. Thus, mean-
ing is understood ag a social convention organized through the relations between signs” (Barker, C.,
2002, p. 29). ‘itis central te Saussures argument thal red is meaningful in relation te tee difference
between red, green, aniber, etc. These signs are then organized into a sequence which generates
meaning through the cultural conventions of their usage within a particular context.
