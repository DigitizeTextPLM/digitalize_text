According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers be “the process by which an innevatron fs eorruTiul-
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovatron
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The: citts
sion of innovations invelves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 40).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass Comme>
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known madel of communication that is analyzed as five parts, 5-M-C-R-E
(eB sender-message-channel-receiver-effect), Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this $-M-C-R-E commu-

nication madel corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion" (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(3) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, “Time” variable

is a very important factor, According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovalion-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables
that inflvence how and wity users and audience adapta new information medium, such as the fnterner.
According fo evolution of media technology, fferpersenal influences are imporiant ever though in the
past the individtval is usually the weit af analysis. Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in
adopting new media because new media are inferactive tools amd thus are required by many users to
gain efficiency, That ix, the more people wre, the miore peanle get benefits. In this sense, diffusion
theory nat only can apply to practical things, but also can be related te digital divide.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innowativeness:
(1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional)" (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined
this teem as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure | shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by Innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories
follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped. Source by ww. gou.edu/ wowedindocs/dif-
fusion’ Figure 2 shows that an innovation would spread through society over various periods of time in
a S-shaped curve. However, as noted above, different types of innovations (¢.z., the rate of tetracycline
adoption is faster than that of the hybrid seed com) can have their own different rates in diffusion. Fig-
