1, RETURN TO GERMANY

1 Return to Germany

ere polished without their permissions in 149, Horkheimer andl Adorno protested, distancing
themselves from their own work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the Late
10s the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises In 1951. Horkheimer
becaroe the Viee-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1964 Adorno published an eseay
eptitel How to Look at Television that was the result al a study that had been done for the
Hacker Foundation, with the involvement af George Gerbner and others. In this essay Adorno
warned, rigid instituticnalization transforms modern Mass culture ito @ medium of wil reamerd
of peychological control (Adorno, 2001a, p. 160). Ip was one of the few occasions in the 19508
that Ademo would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of bis day did not take part in cultural developments
ofthe Bities (Jager, BN, p. 191). Adomo would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape
his theaght on the culture industey. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal paeudo-culture
in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 an The
Culture Industey Pecosidered. In 1956, when writing the exsay Transparencies on Film,
Adoma conceded that film-making might be an accepialte caltoral practice in opposition ba
the calbare imilwetey, within the context of moderniam [Hoherdlabl, 1415, p. 111).
