2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture

Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as appused to
other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satistied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83). The
entirety of society hac become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were to
maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.
Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions
(Marcuse, 1941, p. 8). However, it is difficult in Marcuses argument to separate culture
or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mazs
media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno
had done. In the end Marcuses analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant
ideology. Marcuse wrote, “how can the administered individualswho have made thelr mutilation

themselves from themselves as well as from their masters? How is 1 even Vinita cea

it is somewhat ironic that largely because of it he would be perceived as an ston lor SE
ements of the 1960s in the U.S, and Germany that developed an oppositional’ stance,
Tn spite of this, Marcuse maintained that he was a philosopher, and not an activist. Like oj er
Sarat with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of the idea that theory could be translates
into practice (Chambers, 2004, p, 226).
