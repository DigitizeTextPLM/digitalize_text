1. NEEDS AND GAATIFICATIONS

Five basic assumptions were stated ina stady of Kare, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows.
They Sar framework for understanding the comelatian berween media and audiences:

L. The audience is conceived as active, i.e. an impostant part of of mass media use is
masumed to be goal orented ... patterns of media use age shaped by more or bess
definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have oo offer the audience
member,

Inthe mass communication process noch initiative in linking peed pratificanion and
media choice lies with the wodience member. This places a stromg limitation on
theorizing about any fom of straight-line eect of media coment on attifudes acd
behavier,

The media compete with other sources of meed sacisfaction, The mreds served by
mass Communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs,
and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consump-
Them Certainly varies.

. Methedologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
trem data sepplied by individual audience members themselves: ie. people
are sufficiently sell-aware to be able to repert their interests amd motives in

Particular cases, of af least to recogniee them when confronted with them in an
intelligeble and familiar verbad formulation,

Value judgments about the culoaral significance of mass communication should be
snpenided while audience onentations are exploned om cheir owt terms. (p 15-17)

In addin, Katt. Blumier, and Gorevitch also commented thet, alihough previous researches on
