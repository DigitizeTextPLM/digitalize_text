than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity ard
propaganda (Bernays, 1955, p.22}. Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent a different view of
the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public ts not an amerphous tas which
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66), Instead, Bernays (1928) alfers the idea
that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aime, its objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 66).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presente public relations as a tool that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays,
1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, #5 he recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible, Bermays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them

‘stand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others.
and to persuade of supeesh co while manipulation of
the public ia still possible, it is net in such blatant ignorance of the public opie. Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul tended ta disagree with this peaiot.

were formed years ago, they continue to help us understand the society that surrounds us today.
