A, language is therefore, a social institution and a system of values. [tis the social part of
language, itis essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one
wishes to communicate. Itis because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social insti-
tution, In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization, The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual ect and not toa pure
creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 74-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausure distinguishes the language sysiem into two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which if expressed thraugh the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified, "I propose to retain the word sign feigne} ta
designate the whole and te replace poncept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and

signifier (significant), the last fwe terms have the advantage of indcating the oppasition that sepa-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1859, in R. Innis
fed.) p. Si}. The correspondence of the conceptimeaning to the extemal form is notin the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. [tis not the inevitable intemal relation but the differance
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1940) argues that language does
not reflact a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, bul constructs meaning fram

ries of conceptual and phonic differences’. According in Saussure, “meaning
of selection and combination of signs slong sada es

‘e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (¢-0.. synanyiis), organs

matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another, Despite various possibilities in selecting the 7. within the
