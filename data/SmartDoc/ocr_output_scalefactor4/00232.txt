of conversation and a structure to the daily routine [Beretson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era, Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is ane of the most well-known
and contributed greatly ta establishing the structure of the approach,

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher, He received his Ph.D. in So-
clology in 1956 fromm Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communicatian at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged

with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication fron the 1970s to1990s (UPENN, 2001). lin
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Katz's mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, who is one of the pioneers of gratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theary model. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
notion that peeple use the media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject
which is known as the uses and gratifications research were explored, They viewed the mass media as a means
by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to
their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 which
were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication, They took a more humanistic approach to hee seers
use, They suggest that media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the user and
they have alternate choices to satisfy their need. (Blumler & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that nena
