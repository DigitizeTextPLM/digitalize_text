According to Rogers (1h), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is comma-
nicated through certain channels over time among the members ofa social system, An imovation
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffa-
slog, of innovations iewalves bath mass evedia and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 40). ;
‘That is, by sharing communication channels such os inkerpereonal communication of frHkes Comme ; ts ;
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innervation as useful. Lasswell a
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-C-R-E
(e.g. stder-message-channel-receiver-efliect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this §.hel-C-R-E comme-
Ticalion model comesponds clemely to ihe elements of diffusion" (p. 19) Specifically, (1) sender ;
cen be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be r
interpersmal or mass coenmunicotion, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, amd finally :
(5) the effects can be individual's adegdion or social change. In the diffusion theory, “Time” variable
ia very important factor. According 10 Rogers (1998), time variable is involved in diffusion in {1}
the innovetion-decision process; (2) innovaliveness; (3) an anrcivation’s nite of adoption. Mest inmo-

There are five different types of adopters im the diffusion process. according to Immowaliveness:
0) Inneeniors (vercoresome, (2) Early Adiopoers {respectable}, (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (3) Laggards firaditional}" (Rogers, 45, pp. 183-183). Rogers defined
this term os “the degree to which on individheal is relatively earlier in adopting mew ideas then other
; members of his social sytem” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40} Figure | shows the rolaienships between types
