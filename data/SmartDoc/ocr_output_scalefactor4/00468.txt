1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of lowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewi
one of the founders of social psychology and a pi wneer in the res = ar mata Tape
stantial influence on the uci * > i al ace aiee research eee dynamics, had a sub-
a deve pment of interpersonal communication. After graduation, initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
(Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin’s theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging field of in-
terpersonal communication and on the development of URT. Festinger is best known for

of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Lomparison Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted to
explain how an imbalance among copnitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed CDT
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). CDT allows for three
relationships to occur among cognitions: a consonant velationship, in which cognitions are in equi-
librium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition w ith each
other; and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in questhon have no effect on one another
(West & ‘Turner, 2000), Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of arousal and dis-
comfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Companson Ureory postulates that individuals look to
