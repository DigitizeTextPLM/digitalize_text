an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual act and not to a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1957, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified i$ a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the werd
dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whale and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage af indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis
(ed.), p. a7). The correspondence of the conceptimeaning to the external form is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation but the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that “language does
not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent abjects, but constructs meaning from
within itself through @ series of conceptual and phonic differences”. According to Saussure, "meaning
is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic
(e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g., synonyms), organized into a signifying system" (Barker,
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic communi
members. For a example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the Leslie
