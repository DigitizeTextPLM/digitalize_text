1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been idewified as am important comstrect, necessary to ihe study of conmenu-
fication, it would be beneficial co know when the concept originated, and how it haa been defined
and studied. Cine way to consider ancerainry is through the theoretical framework of informacion
theory, Shannen and Weaver (129) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there
was a high amount of possible alternatives and the prohabilirg of their ewent was relatively eqpaal.
Shunnon ane) Weaver pelared this view of wmcestainry co the transmission of messages, but thear wark
ako contribuned io the developenent of WRT. Berger and Calabrese (17975) adopied concepts from ihe
information theorists a well as Heider (1958) research im attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concep of uncertainty bo fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as
the “number of aleermanve ways in which each inperactant might behave" (p. 100). The greater che
level of uncertainty that exists ima sitaation, the smaller the chance imdivicioals will be able to pae-
dict behaviors and occurrences, During interactions individuals are not only faced with problems of

Predicting present and past behaviors, bul also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way

that they do. Barger and Bradac’s (1582) definition of uncertainty highlighted che complexity of this

process when they siaied: “Uneemainey, then, can stem fram the large number of alirmarive things
thal 4 stranger can believe or potentially say” Uncertainty plays a significant role when examining
relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development. | Jncertointy can
