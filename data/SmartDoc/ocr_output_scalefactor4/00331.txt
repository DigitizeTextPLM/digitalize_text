4 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 Engliahlanguage translation marked the first real appearance of the kiea of the
culture industry outside of a German carlext In the years since there have been Aunmer-
ous criticams of the text, not least since Adomo made sweeping generalizations about “the
commodified and feiwhized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook. Adomo ered in not discussing the processes of cul
tural production, and faiied to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business seciors, including marketing and advertising (Cook. 1994. p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adama and Marcuse overestimated jhe dominant ideolagy. be-
lieving that “capitaliel society languishes in the grip of an al- pervasive reificabon” (Eagleton,
4991, p. 48). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
among oppressed peoples im society has some part to play in the reproduction of ihe aiyps-
tem a8 a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 34). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adomo's idea
of a cufure indusity wae historically limited, since the society that developed im the 18506
and (8706 with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities avaiable during the 140s
{While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industnal soci-
ches between 1920 and 1970, trying to use if today weakens its efectiveness (Hohendahl,

1995. p. 14688). Thus, for a ome critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry would
appear io be merely htoncal, if they in fact conneded thar ithad any walue al all.
