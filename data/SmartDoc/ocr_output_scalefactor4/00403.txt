Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a basic human function in
Which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty, Licer-
fainty Reduction theory (URT), scoredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development of LRT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
esearch. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 153). The study of information is basic
to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the role of communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories as starting points” (p. 9)
The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence ol inter
personal communication research; with the development of URI, COMM Unication researchers begun io lock to
communication for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social

scence.
