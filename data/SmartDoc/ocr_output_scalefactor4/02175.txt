were published without their permission in 1949, Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing
themselves from their own work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the late
1940s the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises in 1951. Horkheimer
became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954 Adorno published an essay
entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of a study that had been done for the
Hacker Foundation, with the involvernent of George Gerbner and others. In this essay Adorno
warned, rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed
of psychological control (Adorno, 2001a, p. 160). It was one of the few occasions in the 1950s
that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments
of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape
his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal peeudo-culture
in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the exsay Transparencies on Film,
Adorno comceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hehendahl, 1995, p. 131).

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into @ systematic context, as opposed po
other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wipgershaus, 104, p. 609). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms im advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale: integration of the individual inte mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
Production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of TEpressive
affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83). The
entirely of society had become organized around an ideclogy whose main objectives were te
minke social control and continue to perpetiate the ideology that maintained that contre.

Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the infortnation and entertainment Aspects
