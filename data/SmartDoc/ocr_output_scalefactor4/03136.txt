2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to
ether writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. #09). Instead of culture Serving,
ideological ends, for Marcuse social conteol mechanisns in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were ta
maintain social contro] and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.

Echoing Adommo, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions
(Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, it is difficult in Marcuses argument to separate culture
or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass
media as entities separate fram the totality of dominat ideology in the same way that Adore
had done. In the end Marcuse: analysis of society allowed for no opposition te the dominant
ideology. Marcuse wrote, “how can the administered individualswho have made their mutilation
inte their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged sea he
themselves from themselves as well as from their masters? How is it even thinkable ‘ito Hie
vicious eincle be broken? (Marcuse, 1991, p. 251). Given the pessimistic tone of the book,
it is somewhat ironic that largely because of it he would be perceived as a tenn for leftist
