and gratifications approach :
a sariselnten eh gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to ce rtain media is almost as old as
empirical mass communication research itself (McQuail, 1983). Dating back to the 19405, ete lots amalts
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such as soap operas and quizzes, a5 well
as daily newspaper [Lazesfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1546; te}. In Mies
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some sp ecific content or by the medium
itself (Katz et al, 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice,
support, or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a siructure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
catisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and grattheations approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when televisian has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars whe focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received his Ph.O. in Sa-
ciology in 1956 trom Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Goyerment of Israel, Katz headed the task force cha reed
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s tel990s (UPENN, 2001). In

1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the Un nersity of Pennsylvania, and alse directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Katz's mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, who is one of the pioneers of gratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of Eratifications
Tunctional theory model. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
hotien that people use the media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a THis

Along with colleague Jay G, Blumer, Katz published a collection of essays on Bratifications in 1974 whict
