That is, by sharing TOMMUncHON Channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu-
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful, Lasewell

(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is andlyzed as five parts, 5-M-C-R-E

(e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect), Rogers (1993) mentioned, “this S-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model cormesponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p- 19) Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
Interpersonal Or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variable
is a Very important factor. According to Rogers (1993), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness: (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Mast inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Ovffision sesearch has otfempied fo explain the variahles

According to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even though in the
past the individual is wally the writ of analysis. Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in
adapting new media because new media are interactive tools and thay are required by many users to
gain efficiency, That is, the more people use, the more people ger benefits, Jn this sense, diffusion
theery notonky can apply to practical tings, but also can be related to digital divide,

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativencss:
“1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditionaly” (Rogers, | 993, pp. 183- 185}. Rogers defined
this term a3 “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1993, p. 40). Figure | shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these eat
