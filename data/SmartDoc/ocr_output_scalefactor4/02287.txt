for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such a3 experience, interests, and
education, affect people's ideas about what they want fram media and which media best meet their
needs. That |s, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications
for using different media. McQuail, Blurmler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person
interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or
problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal
identity: self reference; reality exploration; value relnforces; and (4) Surveillance (forms of informa-
tian seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based
ona general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and

affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus
“internal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “geowth" and "preservation." When charted,
these factors yield L6 different types of motivations which apply te media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. 4
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human metivation (WvicGwire, 1974), Katz, Gurevitch and Haas
(1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
put them inte five catepories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding;
+ Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;

a, Personal integrative needs, including credibility stability, status,

4. Sociol integrative needs, including jateracting with family and friends; and

5, Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.
