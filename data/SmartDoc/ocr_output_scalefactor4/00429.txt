Uses and Gratifications

4.1 Introduction

Lises and gratfications aporaach is an influentsll tradition in media research, The origanal

conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of

perain media contents. The core question of such research i: Why do people use media

and what do they use them for? (McCall 1953). There exists a basic idea in this approach:

guclance members Know media content, and which media they can use bo meat Eee needs.

in the Mass cammunicalion process, uses and gratifications approach puts the function of

linking need gratiications and media choice clearly on the side of audience mambers. |

suggests that people's needs influence what media they woukl chaoée, how they use oer-

tain media and what gratificaiions the media give them. This approach dafers fram other
theoretical parspectives in that it regards audiences as active mace users ao opposed io
passive receivers of information. in contrast to traditional maces eHects Ihearies which focus
on “whal media de to people” and assume audiences ane homogeneous, Uses and gralifica-
tions approach is more concamed with “what people do with media” (Matz, 1959). It allows
audiences personal needs io use media and responds bo the media, which determined by
iheir social and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates
that the media compete wih other information sources for audience's need satisfaction (Katz
etal, 1874a). As traditional masa media and nny media comlinue bo provide peoole with a
wide range of media platiorns and contend, its considered one of the moat aporogriaie
perspectives far investigating why audiences choose to be exposed to differant.

The approach emphasizes audiences’ choice by assessing thelr masons for using
acertain media to the disregard of others, as well as the variois graiifications obtained
fram fhe media, based on individual cocial and paychological requirements (Severin
& Tankard, 1997) J: 2 broader perspective among communication researches, it pro
vides a frameword for understanding fhe processes by which media participants seek
information or content selectvely, commensurate with thelr needs and interests (Katz
etal, 197da). Audience members then incorporate the conmfent to fulfill their needs or
to satiety ther interests (Lowery & Nabila, 1983),
