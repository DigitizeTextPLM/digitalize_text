AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic assumptions were stated ina study of Katz, Blumier, and Gurevitch in 1974 a5 follows. "
They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media and sudiences:

1. The audience is conceived as active, i.e, an important part of of mass media use is
aasumed to be goal oriented ... pamermns of media use are shaped by mare or less
definine expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience

member.

2. Inthe mass communication process much initiative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on
theorizing abowt any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and
behavior.

3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
Tad Comenunication comstinge but a segment ol the wider range of human oeeds,
and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consump-
fitn Certainly varies.

4. Methodologtrally speaking, many of the goals of mass needia use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- Le, people
art sulliciemily self-aware to be able to report thelr interests and motives iin

Particular cases, or at bast te recogniee them whem comfromted with them in an
intelligible amd familiar verbal formulation,

5. Walue judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
uapended while audience orientations are exploted om their own terms. fp. 15-17)

In addition, Katz, Flumler, and Gurevich also commented that. ahhough previews researches on
Biatlfications detected diverse pratifications that altract People on the media, chey did not address the
Conmetions benween these pratificarices (Katz et al., 19744). They suggested thar uses aes pratt.
