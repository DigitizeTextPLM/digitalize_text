| Rogers was born in Carroll, [owa in 1931. He eamed his B.A. MOA, and Ph.D, degrees from Lowa
statte University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the LS. Air Force. Interestingly
in 1966, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea. :
The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creats applications of diffu-
S100 theary in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously
mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was

suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005.
According to Rogers (156), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innevation if ooemmu-
hicated through certain channels aver time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
| san idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption, The diffu.

sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels"
That is,

ip. 40%.

by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu:
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-C-R-E
(e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect), Rogers (1993) mentioned, “this $-M-C-R-E commu-
nication medel comesponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2} message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal of mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption of social change, In the diffusion theory, ‘Time* variable
is a very important factor, According to Rogers (199), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innowation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3} an innovation's rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption, Ojfision research hes attempted to explain the variables

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, acconding to Innovaliveness:
“( 1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185), Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure | shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories
follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped. Source by www? gsu.eduwewith/docadif-
fusion’ Figure 2 shows that an innovation would spread through society Over Various periods oftime in
a S-shaped curve. However, as noted above, different types of innovations (e.g., the rate of tetracycline
adoption is faster than that of the hybrid seed com) can have their own different rates in diffusion. Fig-

there are five stages.

|. Knowledge + or — (selective exposure of awareness of news)

2. Attitudes + or — (people have positive or negative attitude toward innovations)
3. Adoption (Decision): people decide to adopt the innovation
4, Implementation (regular or standard practice)

5. Confirmation (comparing and evaluating}
