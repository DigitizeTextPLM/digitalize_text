PE in ssape, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience’s opinion, and
the sat Sales of the symbols used, By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence that runs from control to content and from content
to audience" (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" (p. 84). Content analysis was esset-
tially the says what part af this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot af work within this area during the
remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content ol propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media Lasswell was particularly
{nterested in examining the effects a1 the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. [n this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented ta them,
and also apprehensive to accept it, However, it is still that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them hy the government. This is an interesting way of ViewIng,

the power of the redia that is somewhal similar to Lippmiann’s theories.
