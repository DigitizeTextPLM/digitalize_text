division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, papular culture on film and radia did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
[Horkheimer and Adorne, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to aa Fordisé
eapitelism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural aphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl,
1996, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adornowere the Hollywood Production system, or
the CBS radio network that had been asiociated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Muvies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work [Horkheimer and Adorne,

2002, p. 0). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would pot be any real change to the aystem,

and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and sdorne, 20M)
