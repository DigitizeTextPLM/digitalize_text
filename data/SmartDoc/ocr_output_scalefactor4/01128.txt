I. EARLY INFLUENCES

Therefore uncertainty isa concept that plays a significant robe in interpersonal communication.
The following thearisis explore how communication can be a vehicle individuals utilize to reduce
uncertainly.

1 Early Influences

The follerving theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communscation.
The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975),

1.1) Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of bowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,
one of the founders of social paychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a sub-
slantial influence an the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but im 145 be followed Lewin to Massachusetts Inati-
tate of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the Mew School for Social Research
cm, 2{HM0). Much of Festinger's research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential an the emerging field of in-
cation and on the development af LART. Festinger & best know af the shears

(West & Tomer, : ). Capnitive Dissonance, like uncenainey, has am element of arousal and dis-
comfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individeals look io
feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual
usually seeks the opinions of others whe are aenilar tothe seli. This need for social comparison can
result in conformity pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, 204), Benger aed Calabrese (1975) related s-
cial comparison to LRT by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons seek oun similar others
who are prommace when they experience a él af uncertainty reparding the appropriateness of
their behavior and/or opinions ina particul no (jp. DOT. Festinger received th Distinguished
Sclemist avwand of the American Psychological intion and the Distingwished Senior Scientist
Award from the Seciety of Experimental Social hology. Fewinger’s legacy is significani, and
his theoretical fence con will be recognized in contemperary sci! science reeearch. Auronson (in
Festieger, 190) stated, “It was in thes era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of
cognitive dissonance, and inimy opinion, social pycholagy haw ned beer the same since” (p. 3).

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Pri fieider earned 4i7 doctorate in phisagty from tbe Universite of Gras. During hic fie in
Enrope, Heder worked with weary nencned prechologist sech as Woiigong Robie: Adar Wertheimer,
and Kent Lewis Heider, like Festinger, recognieed Lewin as a eebsiartial impact on his life: “1 want
be pany tribute to Lewin sirtulating inflarnee, which bas affected much of my ehinking aed whiek bs
still strong even in this book, skhough it does mot derive direcely from his work" CHeigber, 1348, pe
ii). fe L929, Helder moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later the Liniveraity of
anses vhere he veorked Gee the remainder of his life (Ash, 2000).
