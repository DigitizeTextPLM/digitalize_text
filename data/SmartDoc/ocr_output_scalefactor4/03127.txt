1 Return to Germany

were published without their pertnission in 1949, Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing
themselves from their own work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the late
1940s the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises in 1951, Horkhelmer
beeame the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954 Adorno published an essay
entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of a study that bad been done for the
Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner and others. In this essay Adora
warned, rigid institutionalization transforms modern miss culture inte « medium of undreamed
of psychological control (Adorn, 2001a, p. LO). Tt was one of the few oecasions in the Lis
that Adome would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of bis day did not take part in cultural developments
of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on cecasion attempt to reshape:
his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal psewdo-culture
in the United States (Adorno, 199%, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film,
Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendall, 1995, p. 131).

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic comtext, as opposed bo
other writers in the Frankfurt School {Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisens in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2M), p. 144). Capitalist

production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed u system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83). The
entirety of soclety bad become organixed around an ideology whose main objectives were to
maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideclogy that maintained that contral.
Echoing Adore, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions
(Marcuse, 1991, p. &). However, it is difficult in Marcuses argument to separate culture
or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass
modia a8 entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno
bad done. In the end Marcuses analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant
ideology. Marcuse wrote, “how can the administered individualawito have made their mutilation
into their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged sealehiberate
themselves from thernselves as well as from their masters? How is it even thinkable that the
vicious circle be broken? (Marcuse, 1991, p. 251). Given the pessimistic tone of the book,
it is somewhat ironic that largely because of it he would be perceived as an icon for leftist
movements of the 1960s in the U.S. and Germany that developed an oppositional stance.
In spite of this, Marcuse maintained that he was a philosopher, and not an activist. Like others
gssociated with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of the idea that theory could be translated
inte practice (Chambers, 2004, p. 226).

In reviewing the text in 1961, Fnedrich Pollack reported to Adorno and Horkheimer that the
work required teo much revision to receive mass dissemination. The two authors continued to
negotiate with the Fischer publishing house until 1969, and may have only agreed to republish
the work since pirate copies had already been disseminated by individuals.
