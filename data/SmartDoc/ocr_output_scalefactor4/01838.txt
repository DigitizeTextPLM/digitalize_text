that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer maul it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did mot take part itt cultural developments
of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191}. Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape
bis thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1950 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture
in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1964 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered, In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film,
Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition bo
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 141).

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to
ather writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggerstaus, 1994, p. 600). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social contre) mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reite, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
afuence that kept elements of society satished and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were to
maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.
Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment ASpechs
af mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions
(Marcust, 1001, p. 8). However, it is difficult in Marcuses argument to separate culture
Or mass ohedia from society as a whole because Marcuse did oot distinguish culture or mass
