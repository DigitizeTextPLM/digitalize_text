Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theory, Information exchange ts a basic human funetion in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. O'ncer-
tainty Reduction theory (URT), accredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J, Calabrese (1975), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication, Through the development of URT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research, Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 153). The study of information is basic
to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication, URT places the role of communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ sovial psychological theorles as starting points” (p. 99).
The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of inter-

eormmunication research; with the development of URT, communication researchers began to look te
communication for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social
sciences.
