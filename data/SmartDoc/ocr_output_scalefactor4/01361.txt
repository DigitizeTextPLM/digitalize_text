1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1872 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culture industry outside of a German contest. In the years since there have been numer-
ous criticisms of the text, not least since Adoma made sweeping generalizations about “the
commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideolagy, be-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton,
1991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton canceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys-
tem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36), Fredric Jameson pointed aut that Adomo's idea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since tis cies that pee ae
