entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of a study that had been done for the
Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner and others. In this essay Adorno
warned, rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed
ot psychological control (Adorna, 200la, p. 160). It was one of the few occasions in the 1950s
that Adorna would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer foamed it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments
of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape
his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture
in the United States (Adorno, 1994, p- 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film,
Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition ta
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 131).

9 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society inta a systematic context, a5 opposed to
other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society ‘Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affiuence that kept elements of society satished and quiescent [(Alway, 1995, p. 83). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were to
mained social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control
Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions
Marcuse, 1991, p. &). However, it is difficult in Marcuses argument to separate culture
2 tnass media from society as 4 whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass
media. as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno
had done. In the end Marcuses analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant
ideology. Marcuse Wrote, "how can the administered indy dualswho have made their mutilation
