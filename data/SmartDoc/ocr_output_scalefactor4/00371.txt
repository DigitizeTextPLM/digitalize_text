tis eee elicit a series of higher conceptions af understanding media, As a sub-tradition af
media effects research, uses and gratifications approach is suggested to be originally stemmed from @ func:
tonalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974), To some extent, however, functional theory
On Communication agrees with media's effects towards people. For example, a model often used in the the-
ory, the Hypodermic Syringe modal, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential
effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information Into the cansckousness of the masses” {Watson & Hill 1997, p.
105]. Functional theory influenced studies an communication fram the 1920s to the 1940s, After that, a shift
which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses
and gratifications approach.

The exploration af gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as ald as
empirical mass communication research itself (McCluall, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio pragrammes, such a5 soap operas and quirzes, as well
a5 dally newspaper [Lazsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; efc.). In these
Studies, researchers discovered a fist of Functions served elther by some specific content or by the medium
itself [Katz et al, 19746). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisty their listener with advice,
Support, or occasions for emotional release [Herzog 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newpaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure ta the daily routine (Berebon, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the tenm “pratifications.”

Uses and gratiications approach became prevailing in the late 19508 till 2970s when televgion has grown
Up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars whe focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is ane of the most well-known
and contributed greath ta establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Kate is served both as a seclologist and as a communication researcher, He recetved his PhO, in 5o-
chology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 150, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task farce changed
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and tlevision in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s tol990s [UPENN, 2001). In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-dactoral study, ;

Kate’s mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, who ts one of the pioneers of gratifications research,
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification aparoach when he came up with the
notion that people use the media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject
which is known athe uses and gratifications research were explored. They virwed the mass media as 4 toes
by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to
their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973).

‘Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published a collection af essays on gratifications in 1974 which
were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication. They taok 2 more humanistic approach to looking at media
use. They suggest that media were seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs af the wier and
hey have alternate choices ta satisfy their need. (Blumler & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that media
served the functions of survelllance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission for both society

and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974).
