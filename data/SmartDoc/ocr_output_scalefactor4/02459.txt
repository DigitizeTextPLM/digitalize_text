symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's apinian, are
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1546) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence thas rans fram control ta eancent and from content
to audience" (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
statecl, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects” (p. 64), Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, anc Lasswell went on tr doa lot of work within this area ducing the
remainder of his career.

Aside [rom understanding the content of propaganea, Lasswell was also interested in haw propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
imerested in examining, the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is Imited in the information that is presented ta them,
and alse apprehensive ta accepe it. Bawever, it is stil] that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented ta them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories.
