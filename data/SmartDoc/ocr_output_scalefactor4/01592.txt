ous criticisms of the text, not least since oe Deka since there have been numer-

generally sympathetic Deborah C ,p. 113). Fort
orah Cock, Adomo erred in not discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and failad to examine the culture industry s economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Ademeo and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, be-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton,
4991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of deminant values and beliefs
among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys-
tem ag a whole” (Eagleton, 1997, p. 36). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adorno’s idea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the (960s
and 1870s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 140s.
While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial saci-
aties between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohencahl.,

4995, p. 146-48). Thus, for a some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry would
appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value at all.

Thus for some critics modernist works would be counteracting forces against the dominant
idealogy. As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however. it may be the case that the
dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of the culture
industry has had an importance in critical theory since its appearance in the 4940s, in that
it has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation to ideology, and
hence, society, Since Adomo made sweeping generalizabons about the impact of the culture

industry, and since he did not systematically explore how the culture industry operated, it has
been generally easy for some to dismiss the idea of a culture industry. It is nonetheless the
ease that mation pictures are still made by large companies and that their movies largely rely
on formulaic plots. It is also the case that radio is increasingly controlled by a small number
of companies, which tend to impose restrictions an how stations operate. AS 4 See
