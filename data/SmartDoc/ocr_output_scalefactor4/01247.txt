The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
Mass COMMUNIcation constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs,

and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consu mip-
ton certainly varies.

- Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- ie., people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in
particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms. (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous researches on
gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people on the media, they did not address the
connections between these gratifications (Katz et al., 1974a). They suggested that uses and gratifl
cations research concern with following aspects: “(1) the social and the psychological origins of (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead rt 5
ferential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in (6) need gratification a ia -
