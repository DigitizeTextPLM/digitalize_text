Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes waa influenced by Saussure structural linguistics.
To Saussure, the linguistic mechaniam operates on hwo levels, the syetematic system and the variation
by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is thre sysiematized sat
of conventions necessary fo communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which compose
it; a8 opposad to it, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language" (Barthes, 1267,
p.13). Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic systam within the social dimension, The structure bevel,
lanqua, is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabaized and standardized.
On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual lewel. However,
it is considered relatively flexitle due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot bet free from thee
shared convention, the shracture.

A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of
language, itis essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirely ifone
wishes to communicate, Its because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a sacial ineti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
af the language with a view to expressing his parsonal thought. lt is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual act and not to a pure
crestion. (Barhes, 1867, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into bwo paris, the
signified and the signifier, The signified is a cancept or meaning which is expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the ward
dog in English or im Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. “| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifia) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposiion that sepe-
rstes ther fram each other and from the whole of which they are parts” (Saussure, 195%, in R. Innis
fed,), p. 37). The correspondence of the conceptimeaning fo the extemal form is not in tee: destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation, [tis not the inevitable intemal relation but the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying system, Saussure (1960) argues that “language dows
net reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning fram
within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences". According to Saussure, "meaning
ig produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic
(e.g. @ sentence) and the paradigmatic (é.g., synonyms), organized Into a signifying system” (Barker,

2002, p. 23), As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-

matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can

be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the

same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community

members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the follow-

ing sentence: “I went to a theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence is established through the

linear combination of signs. The signa within the example, such as | theater, my, and girlfriend can be
substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as “She went to a restaurant with her mother."
Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated only when
they are related to each other. "Crucially, signs de not make sense by virtue of reference to entities in
an independent object world; rather, they generate meaning by reference to each other. Thus, mean-
ing is understood as a social convention organized through the relations between signs” (Barker, C..
2002, p, 29). “itis central to Saussures argument that red is meaningful in relation to the difference
between red, green, amber, etc. These signs are then organized into a sequence which generates
meaning through the cultural conventions of their usage within a particular context.
