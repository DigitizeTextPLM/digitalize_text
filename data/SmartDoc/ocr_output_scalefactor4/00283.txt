I. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS WASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond an ;
Europe. Further, the prevalence af advertising in the United States maeasaliecirie ck
in Europe. The closest thing in Adoarnos expetionce to the advertising industry in the United States
wis fascist propaganda (Jiger, 2004, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to bla experience with
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statictical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw thla research as being indlstinguishable from political

Propaganda (Horichelmer and Adarna, D002, p. 97). Tt became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Ademno did
not apres on the value af empirical studied, and Adorno left the project. Adornos dissatisfaction with
the wark of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually mativate him to further develop
the idea of the culture industry.

Secouse of the relationship betwen the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University,
Horkheimer, whe had already moved to California, could net bring Adorno to the Weat Coast until
November 1941, When Adorno sas finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate comabunity Eat
included Fritz Long, Arnold Schoenberg, Hana Bister, Thomas and Meinrich idann, Alfred Dathiin, and
Bertolt Breckt, several of which found work in fhe Aolivwosd movie industry. The fact that Adorno
was port of iis infellectioal community whose members were ineoleed in the production of Wodiywaad
Movies must hace hod some influence in developing his thoughts on culture, since the Hollywood system
inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had enjeyed in Weimar Geran.

These preconditionsAdornos interest in nvusic, bis frinndship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radia Project, as well as invelvement with the expatriate community in California and the
relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all impartant ta An Understanding of
his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

Por Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother ta present itsclf as art, They were instead
& business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
tapltaliaen, in whieh mass prodection based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendall,
1985, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adormowere the Hollywood production system, or
the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work [Horkheimer and Adorno,
2002, p. GO. Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would mot be any real change to the system,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge [Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p.
10-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, and Adorno cited Orsan Welles
as an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would
allow it to assume the stance of any oppositlon and make it its awn, ultimately rendering it ineMectual
(Friedman, 1981, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
of social control [Horkheimer and Adotno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system af economic
coercion ultimately meant th

industry, but modernism. Although he provides the idea of an opposing force to the culture industry,
