research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty, U'ncer-
tainty Reduction theary (URT), accredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J, Calabrese { (975), recognized that
reducing uncertainty Was at -niral motive of communication. Through the development of LRT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research. Heath and Bryant P2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 134). The study of information is base
to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. URI places the role af communication tobe the central
focus which was 4 key step in the development af the field of interpersonal oom munication Berger and Cal
