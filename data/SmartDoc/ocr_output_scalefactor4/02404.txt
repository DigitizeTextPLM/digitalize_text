satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term "gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the tate 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is ome of the mast well-known
and contributed greatly te establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Kate if served both as a sociologist and a3 a communication researcher He received his Ph.D, in So-
clolagy in 1956 fram Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicaga until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. in the late 1560. invited by the Government of israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 2970s to1990s (UPENN, 2001). In
1993, he joined the faculty of the Anmenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and alee directed its

Katz's mentor in Columbia Uniwersity is Paul Lazarsteld, whols one of the peoneers of pratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theory model. Later, Katz intraduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
nation that peogle use the media to their benefit. Ina study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject
which is known as the uses and gratifications research were explored. They viewed the mass media as a means
by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to
their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay. Blumler, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 which
were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication, They took a more humanistic approach to looking at media
use. They suggest that media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the user and
they have alternate choices to satisfy their need, [Blumer & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that ficems
served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural ¢ ission for both society
and individuals [Mumler and Kate, 1974).
