a Lasswell (1112-1978) was a prominent scholae in the area of peopaganda neseaech. He focesed on
conducting both quantitive and quaknative analysis of propaganda, understanding the coment of prapaganuta,
and) dacowering the effect of propagaedaon the mass audience (Hogers, 14), Lasswell is credited with creating
the mass comimradication procedure of content atalpsis (Rogers, 144) Generally, conten analysis can be
defined a5, “the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message Content into claseiiications

Lasswell (2946) explains that a content analysis: should take inte account the Eneqparncy with which certain
symbols appear ina message, the direction in which che symbols iry to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols ised. By undersanding the content of the message, Lasewell (1546) aims te
achieve the goal of understanding the "siream of influence that runs from canal io coment and from oongent
0 audience” (p. 74).
