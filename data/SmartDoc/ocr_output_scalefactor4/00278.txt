Adomo was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin
never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno
became s effect Benjamins only pupil, After Benjamin’s death “it was Ademo who then introduced a rational-
ized version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (iger, 2004, p. 65-4), The relationship with Benjamin had
an Impact on the development of Adornos thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began
teaching at the Institute. Adomo lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi
party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began
Operuting there. The Nazis rise to power net only meant that Adorno lost his jeb and would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As J0rgen Habermas would later note, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe-

riences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48}.

Adome was al Oxford from 1934 to 1998, where he worked on a manuseript on Husserl, He was considered
an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frank-
furt School colleagues, many of whem had in the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the late
1930s Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
19305, Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means.

(Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Artin the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adamo lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adome was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together

with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adorno, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adorno, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea- to down. of layers of imitations; to Adora, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adorno. In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in
New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, ron by Paul Lazars-
feld. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although he later claimed that he did not know what a “radio project” was. For his part,
Lazarsfeld looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be an expert on music, Adore
wrote for the Project’s journal in 1941, reiterating his position that radio was only an image of a live perfor-
mance. In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio industry that the medium was bringing serious music
to the masses (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 243). While working at the Princeton Radia Research Project Adorno
became shocked at the degree to which culture had become commercialized in the United States.
