A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. Mis the sacial part of

resists the modifications corning fram a single individual and is consequently a social insti-

an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code

of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is

creation. (Barthes, 1287, pp. 14-15)

| Focusing on the systematic level, Sausume distinguishes the language system into two parts, the

signified and the signifier, The signified ig a concept or meaning which i expressed through the form.

The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English of in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the gignified, “| propose to retain the word sign (signa) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifia) and
signifier (significant); the test two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sapa-
rates them from each other and from tie whole of which they are paris" (Saussure, 1959, in Fe. Innis
