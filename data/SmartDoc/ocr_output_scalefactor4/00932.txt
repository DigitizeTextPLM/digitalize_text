CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Pasties of the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing
ae Pinon (Bernays, 1945, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase,
are of coment, He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more

anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity and
propaganda (Bernays, 1954, p22). Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent a different view of
the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this, He claims, The public i not an amorphous mass which
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1925) offers the idea
that in attempting te influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial. Tt must explain itself, ite aims, its objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. Gi).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1052). Rather than merely attempting ta
manipulate the public throweh propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the perauader. The objectiveminded public relations
man helpe his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust ta it (Bernays,
1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that af Lippmann, as he recogaizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is posible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefies of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the soctety of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that aHects us, to evaluate elforts being made by others,
and to persuade or suggest courses of action (p. LM}. Under this framework, while manipulation af
the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinian. Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Laazwell, Elid, and Hernays are important for a tember af
reasons. Based on the ideas of hia predecessora, Lippmann wos agile to bring attention fo bhe fect that
the public is able to be injiuericed by the media, The work of Lippmann and his colleagwes has fed to tore
recend redearoh that ia mean√© do help understand the influence of the media on the public. Through the
work Iyengar and Kinder, White, fewin, and MeCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensite understanding
af the media Aua heen decetoped. The public has now een made asare various media functions such aa
agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming, and the potentiol effects that fheae feckniyuds can kave or
their audiences.

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the direct effects and limited effects
media models. Theorista such as Ellul tended te side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
propaganda could direct ly influence the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, theorists suck as Lippmann.
also noted thar the media might not be influencing only thought, but may also be influencing what
people thought about, Tt was this line of thinking that reatlted inl starting point for future research
in the area of the limited effects of the media. Such Lralted effect were shown through the work af
Iyengar and Tinder, a8 well a MeCrabs and Shaw. Gwerall, the risearch af the scholars digeussedd in
this paper has bees very important to the understanding caf thee media, the manipulation of the public,
and the formation of public opinion. While the thearies of Lippmann, Lasewell, Bernas, and Ellul
were formed years age, they continue to help us understand the society that sucrounds us today.
