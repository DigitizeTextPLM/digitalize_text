vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables
that influence how and why users and audience adopt anew information medium, such as the Internet.
According ta evolution af media technology, interpersonal influences are important even though in the
past the individual ix usually the unit of analysis, Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in
adopting new media because new media are interactive tools and thus are required by many users to
gain efficiency. That is, the more people use, the mare peanle ger benefits. Jn this sense, diffusion
theory not only can apply to practical things, but also can be related to digital divide,

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
“(1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40}. Figure 1 shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve, oa una
