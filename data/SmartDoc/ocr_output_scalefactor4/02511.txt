1.1) Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of lowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin, Lewin,
one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had & sul-
stantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After praduation, initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1445 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
(Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential an the eee ae 2 _
