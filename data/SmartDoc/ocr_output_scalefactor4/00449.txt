commodified and fatishined character of all cuBural goods’ [Coak, 1996, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adore erred in not discussing the proarsses of Cul-
iural production, and failed to examine the culbire industry's economic dapendence en other
business aeciors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1596. Pp 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse cwereslimated the dominant ideciogy, be-
lieving that “capmtalisl socety languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagieion,
1901. p. 48). Stil, Eagleton conceded that “the diffuaian of dominant values and beliels

dominant deology can co-opt modemist works for ite cen ends. The idea of the culture
industry has had an importance in crifical theory since its appearance in the 1940s, in that
it has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation to ideology, and
