fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was One of the historical expe”
riences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48). :
Adorno was at Oectord trem 1934 to 1938, where he worked on a manuscript on Huser. He was considered
an outsider, never integrating inte the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to jolning his Frank=
furt School colleagues, many of whom bad in the meantime moved to the United States, Already in the late
1030s Adorno evidenced litte: hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adora debated masa culture, since film and radio became the tyo most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. ‘The essay translated as “Cin the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work af Art inthe Age of Mechanical Reproduction™ (Bronkborst, 195%, p. 62). A pri-
mary peablem for Adomo lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed ina concert hall, symphonic works eould
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
ariginal, and Adorno was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with spoet and film, mass music and the new listening help ta make escape from the whele infantile milieu
impossible” (Adomo, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tled to class, to Adame, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity, To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order fram the top-ihe original or Idew= te down of layers of imitations; to Adomo, mass
production was nothing but the destnaction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adomea. In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to contioue working in
New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radin Research Project, run by Paul Lazara-
feld. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although be later claimed that he did not know what a “radio project” was, For his part,
Lazarsfeld looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he Knew to be an expert om music. Adorno
wrote for the Project's journal in 1941, reiterating his position that radia was only an image of a live perfor:
mance. In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio industry that the medium was bringing serious arin‘
to the masses (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 243). While working at the Princeton Radio Research Project hans
