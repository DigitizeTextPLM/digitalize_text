Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural linguishcs.
Te Saussure, the linguistic mechaniam operates on two levels, the systematic system and the vanation
by Spegemg aciors, The former i called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the syshematined set
of conventions necessary to Communicabon, ind#lerend to the material af the signal which compose
ie as opoosed be it, speech (parole) ia covers the purely individual part of language” (Barthes, 1967,
p.13). Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimension, The siructure level,
lanqué, 1s tne social cocweniion or value shared through a society whech i shabilizéd and standardized.

on the contrary, parole is flexible becaude it ts the actual expression af the individual vel However,
his considered relatively faxible due to the fact tn

at speech by an individual cannot be free from the
shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore, -& social institution and a system of values. [tip the social part of
language, itis essentially & collective contract which one must accept in its enbrety if ane
wiehes to communicate. ie bacause @ language is a syatem of conmfractual values that if
pesints the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social inah-
futon. in contrast to language, which is both ingbtuton and sysiem, speech is esserdialty
an individual act of salection and actuslizaton. The speaking subject can use the code
of ihe language with a view bo expressing his personal thought. It & becauee speech
