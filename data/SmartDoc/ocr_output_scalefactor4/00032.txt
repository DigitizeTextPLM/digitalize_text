Uncertainty Reduction

L1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twenticth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainhy, Dncer-
tainty Reduction theory (URT), xcredited to Charles RK. Berger and Richard J, Calabrese (1973), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was acentral motive of communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “Qne of the motivations underpinning interpersestal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 153). The study of information is basic
to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the role of communication into the central
focus which wos a key step in the development of the field of interpersanal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrest (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories a5 starting points” (p. 95).
The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporanes marked the emergence of inter-
personal communication research; with the development of URT. communication researchers began te look to
communication for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social
