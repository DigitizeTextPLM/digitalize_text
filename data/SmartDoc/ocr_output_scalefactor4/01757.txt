it is well accepted that communication thearies have developed through the realms of psychology and so-
ciology aver the past 100 years. With illumed by valuable Ideas as well as exploring mare untilled fields in these
two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding media, As asub-tradition af
media effects research, uses and gratifications approach is sugmested to be originally stemmed from a func
tonalist paradigm in the social sconces [Blumler & Katz, 1974]. To some extent, however, functional theany
on communication agrees with media's effects towards people. For example, a model often used in the the-
ory, the Hypodermtic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential
effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ infarmation into the consciousness of the masses” [Watson & Hill 1297, p.
105), Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1940s. After that, a shift
which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses
and gratifications approach.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate peaple ta be attracted to certaln media is almost as old as
empirical mass communication research itself (McCluail, 1983}. Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became
interested in the reasons for ewing different radia pragrammes, such as soap operas and quizzes, a5 well
as daily newspaper {Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Merzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc.). In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium
itself (Katz et al, 1974b), For instance, radia soap operas were found to satisfy thelr listeners with advice,
Support, of occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was alsa discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berebon, 1945]. For these diverse dimensions of uiage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and pratifieations approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it wad rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elitw Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the strecture of the approach.

Elihu Katz Is served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in So-
eSology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963, During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government of israel, Katz headed the task force changed
with the introduction of television broadéasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s tol goos (UPENM, 2001). In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennaylvania, and alee directed its
experimental scholars program for post-doctoral study,

Kate's mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, whois ome of the pioneers of gratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theory model. Later, Katz intraduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
nation that people use the media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject
which is known as the uses and gratifications research were explored. They viewed the mass media as a means
by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to

their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch amd Haas, 1973),

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler Katz published a collection af essays on gratifications in 1974 which
were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication. They took a more humanistic approach te looking at media
use. They suggest that media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the user and
they have alternate choices to satichy thelr need. (Blumler & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that media
served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission for both society
and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974),
