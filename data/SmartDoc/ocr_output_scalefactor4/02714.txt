The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creats applications of diffu-
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology. political science, and, as previously
mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 becouse he was

suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2003. A re
According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation 1s Commu
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
is an idea, practice or object perceived aa new by an individual or aher unit of adoptron. The diffu:
sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal CcOMmunicalion of mass COMmMmu-
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, §-M-C-R-E
(e.g, sender-message-channel-receiver-effect}. Rogers (199%) mentioned, “this §-M-C-R-E commiu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can he inventors or opinion headers, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, anid finally
(3) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variable
is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is invelved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2} innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption, Djfficion research has attempted to explain the variables

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
ai Innovators (venturesome}, (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (3) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1998, pp, 183-185). Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure | shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories

idea When i comes to the process of innovation-decisions, Rogers (1995) mentioned that

|. Knowledge + or —(selective exposure or awareness of news)
2. Attitudes + or ~ (people have positive or negative attitude toward innovations)
3, Adoption (Decision): people decide to adopt the innovation

4. Implementation (regular or standard practice)

4, Confirmation (comparing and evaluating)
