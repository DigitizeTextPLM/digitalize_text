agenda during the past two decades" (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus
on dyadic communication, communication invelving face-to-face interaction, or communication as
a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically
focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relathonships, It has been recognized
that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).
Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has

contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus

on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work

is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our

understanding of interpersonal processes.

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important consirect, necessary to the study of comunu-
nication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined
and studied. Cne way to consider uncertainty 1s through the theoretical framewerk af information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there
was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability af their event was relatively er
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their wi
