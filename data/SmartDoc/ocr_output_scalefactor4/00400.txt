According to Rogers (1995), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of'a sacial system, An Innovation
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption, The diffu-
sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).

That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commit
nication peaple can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation a5 useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-C-R-E
(eg., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this S-M-C-R-E comimu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion" (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
con be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be anew idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, “Time” variable
isa very important factor, According 1 Regers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innevation-decision process; (2) innovativeness, (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
wations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffsion research has attempted to explain the variables

_ There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativencss:
(1) Innovators (ventureseme), (2} Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate) (a)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (3) Laggards (traditional) (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined
