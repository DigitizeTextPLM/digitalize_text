1 The Culture Incustry: Enlightenment 25 Mass Deception

For Adorns, popular eelture on film and rade did not bother ta present Hteclf an art. They were instead
a business, aad this ia turn became am Heokgy bo begitimniee: the trash they intentionally product
(Horkbermer and Adorn 9000, p. W), This business was hesed on what Adorno referred bo a Fordist
capitalism, in-which mass production bevsedl om the tochaikqees used by Heery Ford wane implemented in
the colturel ephere, insofar as those tendencies were haeed on cerisilization ated hierarchy (Hobencial),
1995, p42). Examples of thisnot spevilied by Adernowere the Holly production system, oF
dhe CHS ralio network that had been associated gath the Princeton Hacio Fesearch Project. Movies
and bit songs were based on formulas, and the feemula, popplasts the woek (Horkhetmer and Adorn,
Ke, p. OG). Mechanical reproduction ensured that tscne mul got ke any real change bo the system
anid that méhing traly alversarial be Uke system a@cokd emerge (Hockheaner and Adorno, 2002, a
106-7). Paradomeally, amg meovation wild only reaffiem tbe eystess, and Adorno erbed. Orson Welles

allow it bo assume the stance of aay opposition asd make it its own, altimetely eerdering it ineffectual
(Friedman, 1981, p. 165). Like region and other Gevtitutions, the culture dustry was en leatroment
of social conérol [Horkheimer and Adorn, HME, p. Let), bet freedom to choos in aaysbem of enonome:
enetclon ultimately meant the freedom to be the same (Horkheiser and Adore, S002, p. La)

cgi defines avant-garde art aa the adversary of the culture industry {Hockheirner and
re, DOMED, ps 101). it was not high art that Adorno was presenting as an alternative to the culvare
industry, Lot negro Although he provides the idea of on opposing foot to the calture industry,
Adorno provides na over Marxist analysis. Instead, be notes im passing that the domin walla
had been, in his esaye on gvosie: and radio, an apparent defender of high art, The
Culture Industry has been critiieed aa being a defense of high art, ne oppeeed to popular culvare.
Adorns epecificnlly defines avant-garde art aé the selversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer
Adorno, 2002, p. LOM). Ke
