itis well accepted that communication theories have developed through the realms of psychology and so-
ciology over the past LOO years. With illumed by valuable ideas as well as exploring more untilled fields in these

two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding media, As a sub-tradition of
media effects research, uses and gratifications approach ls suggested to be originally stemmed from a fune-

Tonalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumber & Katz, 1974), To some extent, however, functional theory
on COMMUnICaTION agrees with media's effects towards people, For example, a model often used in the the-

| ory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential
effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information inte the consciousness of the masses” (Watson & Hill 1997, p

| 105). Functional theory influenced studies on communication fram the 1920s to the 1940s. After that, a shift

| which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses

| and gratihications approach.

| The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as

| empirical mass communication research itself (MoQuail, 1983). Dating back to the 19404, researchers became

| interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such as 50ap operas and quizzes, as well

| a5 daily newspaper [Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944: Warner & Henry, 1948: ete). In these

THUdles, reiearchers discovered a list of functions served either by same specific cenvtent of by the medium

| sell [Ratz et al, 1974). For instance, radio soap operas were found te satisfy their listeners with advice,
