1 Needs and Gratifications

ses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the sell-perceived needs of audience mem-
bers. Blumer and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication mes-
sage for very different purposes. The same media content may gratily different needs for different

individuals. There is not only one way that people uses media. Contrarily, there ane as many reasons
for using the media as there are media users (Blumer & Katz, 1974).

Basic reeds, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and
education, atlect peop

ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their
needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and grabtications
for using diferent media, MicQuail, Blurnler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-persan

interactions’ ta classify four important media gratifications: |1) Diversion; escape from routine or

problems; emotional release: (27) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility, (3) Personal
identity: self reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance [forms of informa
Hen seeking),
