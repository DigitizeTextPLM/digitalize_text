1.400 Hareld Laswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In
fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself
(Rogers, 1954).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominer scholar im che area of propaganda research. He focused on
conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, undensanding the contest of peopaganda,
and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswelll is credited with creating
ihe mass Communication pracadune ol conmne analysis (Rogers, L444) Generally, content analysis can be
defined as, "the investigation of conmmranhcation messages by calegoncing message content into classifications
in order bo measure certain variables” (Rogers, 1944). In am essay entiiled “Coonbents of Comeenicaton,”
Lasswell (1946) ewplains that 2 content analysis should take inn account the frequency with which ceriain
imbok appear ina message, the direction in which the symbols oy to persuade the aedience’s opinion, asa
the imensicy of the syoabols used. By undersianding the comeni of the message, Lasswell (1546) aims to
achaeve the geal of onderianding the “siream of influence thal rans from conerol to content and from content
bo audience ip. 7a.

This method of content analysis is tied sirongly 6 Lasvwell (1953) early definmion of communication which

Aside from undersianding the comer of propaganda, Lasvwell was. aleo interested im how propaganda could
