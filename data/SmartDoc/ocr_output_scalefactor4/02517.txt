Uses and gratifications aporoach became prevailing in the late 19506 till 1970s when television has grown
Up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and pratitications research, Elihu Kate is ane of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz ig served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received he PhO in So-
clology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the mext thirty years, he taught in the Department of Socalogy and Communicatian at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government of brael, Katz headed the task force charged
with the Intreduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 19706 tol 590s (PENH, 2001). in
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its
