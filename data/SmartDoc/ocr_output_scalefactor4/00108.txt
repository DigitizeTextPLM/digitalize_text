Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced Saussure structural
To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two at taveecie system and that
by speaking actors. The fonmer is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized get
of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal whieh compose
it, @% Opposed to it, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language’ (Barihes, 1987,
p.13). Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimension. Tha structure level,
langue, is the social convention or value shared through a society which ie stabilized and standardized.
On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual lavel, However,

it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the
shared convention, the siructure.

A language is therefore, -a secial institution and a system of values, It is the social part of
language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one
wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications corning fram a single individual and is consequently a social instl-
tubon. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speach is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view fo expressing his personal thought. It is beacause speach is
essentially & combinative activity that il corresponds to and individual act and motte a pure
creation. (Banhes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic lavel, Sausurre distinguishes ihe language sysbem inion two parts, the
signified and the signifier. Thre signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the extemal part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English of in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. “| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (eignifié) and
signifier (significant); the last two temms have the advantage of indicating he opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and fram the whole of which they are parts” (Saussure, 1959, in Ri. brs
(ed.), p. 37). The correspondence of the conceptimeaning to the external form is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. [tis not ihe inevitable internal relation but the differance
between the signs that operates ihe signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that “language does
not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning fram
within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences”. According to Saussure, “meaning
is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic

(e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g., synonyms), organized into a signifying system” (Barker,
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the follow-
ing sentence: “I went te a theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence is established through the
near combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as | theater, my, and girlfriend can be
substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as “She went to a restaurant with her mother.
Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated only when
they are related to each other. "Crucially, signs do nat make sense by virtue of reference to entities in
an independent object world; rather, they generate meaning by refarence to each other. Mites mean-
ing is understood as a social convention organized through the relations between signs” (Barker, C.,
2002, p. 29). “itis cantral to Saussures argument that red is meaningful in retation to the difference
Riicesa red, green, amber, etc. These signs are then organized into a sequence which generates
meaning through the cultural conventions of thelr usage within a particular conbest.
