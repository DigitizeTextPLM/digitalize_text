. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived

from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- ie,, people

are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in

particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an

intelligible and familiar verbal formulation,

. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms. (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous researches on
aratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people on the omtdia, they did mot address the
connections between these gratifications (Katz et al., 1974a). They suggested that uses and gratifi-
eations research concern with following aspects: “(1) the social and the psychological origins af (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) dif-
ferential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in i) need gratification antl 7) other
consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones” (Katz et al., 1974b, p. 20). The studies of Katz and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the uses and gratifications approach. Since
then, the research on this subject has been strenethened and extended. The current stamus of uses and
gratifications ig still hased on Kate's first analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in
such an électronic information age when people have more options of media use.
