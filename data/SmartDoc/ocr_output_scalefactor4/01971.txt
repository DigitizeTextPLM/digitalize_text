ia EARLE INFLUENCES

Therefore unceraincy is a concept that plays o significant role in interpersonal comenunication,
The following theeeises explore how ceenmunication can be a vehicle imdividuals utile to reduce
uncertainty.

1 Early Influences

The follwing theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication.
The influence of their week can be seen reflected in the aewumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1575),

1.1) Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Lowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,
one of the founders of sacial psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a ab
dantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, imitially
worked af the University of Rochester, bur in 1944 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Tmsti-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Growp Dynamics. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the Mew School for Social Research
(Samelson, S00). Much of Festinger’s research followed his eventor Lewin and further developed
Lewin’s theories, Several af Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging Geld of m-
berperscnal communication amd om the development of URT, Pesinger for thee theories
of Cognitive Dissonance and Socal Comparcan. Cognitive Dissonance theory TT) attempbed fa
explain how an instalance among cognitions might affect an indivedwal. Lewin foreshadowed! CDT
in his observations regarding attitude change in stall groups (Festinger, 1982). CDT allkews foe three
relationships to occur among cogaitions: o consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in oqai-
lium wath each other; 2 dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each
other; and on inrelevard relationshap, im whieh the cognitions in question have no-¢lTget on one another
(West & Tumer, 1000) Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has a clement of arousal and dis-
comfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory postullabes that imdivideals look to
feedhack from others to evaluate their perlormance and abilities, To evaluate the eel, Che indivedual
usually seeks the opinions of others whe are similar to the self This need for social comparison con
result in comformaly pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, 2004). Berger and Calabrese (1973) related so-
cial comparison 1 UBT by sinting that “Festinger has suggested that persons seek out similar others
who are proximate when they experience a high kew uncertainty regarding the approprialeness of
jheir behavior andice opinions in a particular stuation” (p. 107). Festinger received the Dastinguished
Scientist award of che Aumerican Paychological Association and the Distingsished Sentor Scientist
award) from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Feslinger’s legacy agniticern,, sel
his (heorectical inflwence can still be recognized in contemporary social science esearch, Amoweon (in
Festinger, 1980) stated, “It was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory af
cognalive dissonance, and in my opinion, social psychology has not been Oe sane since" (p, 3),

1.2 Fritz Heider (18-1954)

Fritz Heider panna! fie docioreve jn piitosopey from the University af Graz. Dering his fie in
Europe, Helder worked with many renowned pepyrha iggist secitas Malfgang Kotter, Aor Periieimer:
and Kurt Lewin, Helder, liloe Festinger, recogeined Lewin as a sabsiantial impact on his life: “ veant
to pay eribute to Lewin stimulating influence, which has affected much of my thinking and which is
alll strong even in this book, although it does not derive directly froen his work” (Heider, 1928, p.
vii). In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to work al Smith College md later the University of
Kansas where he worked for the remainder of bis life (Ash, DIMM.
