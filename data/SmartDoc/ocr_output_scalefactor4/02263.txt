1. Return to Germany

lished without their permission in 1540, Horkheimer atl Adorno protested, distancing
rien from their own work, in ofder nut to jeopandine their return to Germany. In the late
1940s the Institwie relocated to Frankfurt, ami opened in its new premises 121 1951. Horkheineer
became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954 Adorno published ye
entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of a study that had been dome the
Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of Gearge Gertmer and others. In this essay Adorno
warned, cged institutionalization transforms modern masa culture Leto a medium of utd reared
of payehologlesl control (Adorno, 200La, p. 160). Ht was one of the few oorasiand in the 195s
that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture. Ae least one observer found it
strange that the leading calbural theorist of his day did mot take part in cultural developments
of the Bitles (Jager, MMM, p. 191). Adorno wonld nooetheles on ofcastn attempt to reshape
his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1999 he wrate aula universal pseudo-culture
inthe United States (Adorno, 1995, p. 21), amd gave 4 radia talk in Germany in 1964 on The
Culture Lndastey Recomidered In 1966, when writitig, the exay Transparencies on Fom;
Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition ta
the culkare industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1h, p. 131).

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcose put an analysis of late capitalist society into & aystematic coment, os opposed tc
other writers ln the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 194, p. 609) Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in alvanced industrial sockety ensure
the wholak integration of Ube individual into mass society (Reitz, SOOO, p. 144). Capitalist
production aml thé tremendoos wealth that ceralted from it formed a system of repressive
allwence that kept elements of sockety satisfied and quiescent [Alway, 1005, p. 83). The
exiirety af eocety had become omaniees arcond an ideology whose Hain objectives were to
Tmamtein social control and comings to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that contral.

Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and enbernment aspects

of mass media could be iffewntiated from their manipulation and ineictrinaftion fimetbone
(Marcuse, 1891. p. §|

Hower, it @ difficult in Marcoses argument to separate calture
of mass media from society as a whole becwest Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass

ead done. In the end Marcums analysis of somety alkrwed for no opposition to the domninast
ideclogy, Marcuse wrote, “bew can Ue alinkanbered individialswho have made their mudlation

movements of the 1000s in the U8. and Germany thar developed an oppositional stance.
Te epite of this, Marcuse meainiained that he was a philosopher, aed not an activist, Like others

To reviewing the text in 101, Predeich Pollack reported to Ademco and Horkhiner that the
