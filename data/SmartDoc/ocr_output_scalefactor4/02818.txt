Rogers was born in Carroll, lowa in 1931, He eamed his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from lowa
Siate University, Fortwo years during the Korean War, he served in the U5. Air Force, Interestingly,
in 1966, he worked on some family planning communication projects in korea.

The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creats applications of diffu-
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously
mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was
suffering from kidney disease, He died on October 21, 2005,

According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu-
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu-

nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, $-M-C-R-E
(e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this 5-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass conmunication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(3) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, “Time* variable
is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables
thar influence how and why users and audience adapta new information medi, such as the Intermet.
According to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even though in the
past the individual is usually the wnit of analysis, Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in
adopting new media because new media are interactive tools and thus are required by many users to
gain efficiency. That is, the more people ase, the more people get benefits, Jn thix sense, aliffiction
theory not only can apply to practical things, but also can be related te digital adiviele.
There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innowativeness:
“(1) Innovators (venturesome}, (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (3) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-183). Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure | shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories
follow a standard deviation curve which ts bell-shaped, Source by wow? gsu.eduwaawitndocs/dif=
fusion! Figure 2 shows that an innovation would spread through society over various perioss of time in
a S-shaped curve. However, as noted above, different types of innovations (e.g., the rate of tetracycline
adoplion is faster than that of the hybrid seed com) can have their own different rates in diffusion. Fig-

cepvl2. html When it comes to the process of innovation-decisions, Rogers (1995) mentioned that
there are five stapes.

I. Knowledge + or — (selective exposure or awareness of news)
2. Attitudes + or — (people have positive or negative altitude toward innovations}
3. Adoption (Decision): people decide to adopt the innowation

4. Implementation (regular or standard practice)

§. Confirmation (comparing and evaluating}
