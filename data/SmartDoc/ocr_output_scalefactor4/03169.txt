l. OTHER PROPAGANDA PHEORISTS

1 Other Propaganda Theorists

1.1 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was wt UNE propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In
fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself
(Rogers, 1994). :

Harold Lasswell (19032- 1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on
conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda,
and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (R ogers, 1994), Lasswell is credited with creating
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis can be
defined as, “...the investigation of communication messa pes by categorizing message content into classifications
in order bo measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1954). In an essay entitled “Contents of Communication,”
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
s¥inbols appear in a messa ge, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that runs from control to content and from content
to audience” (p. 74)

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, “Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" (p. B4). Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the
remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganca could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that ts presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it, However, it is still that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories.

1.2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion ana propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public eae Bermays (13ee)
