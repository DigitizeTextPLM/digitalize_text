operating there, The Nazis rise to power not only meant that Adore lest his job and would eventually toree a
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jorgen Habermas would rohan: t
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was ane af the historical expe-
riences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48). :
Adorno was at Chcford from 1934 eo 1998, where he worked on a manuseript on Husserl He was considered
an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frank-
furt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. Already om the late:
19308 Adere evidenced little hape for mags culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adore debated mass culture, since film and radia became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships, The essay translated a3 “On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a peasimistie reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Act inthe Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkborst, 1999, p. 62). A pr-
mary problen for Adore lay in the fet that instead of being enjoyed in a comeert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard ower the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result waa inferior to the
original, and Adora wad empliaive m has condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
wilh Sport ard film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adoma, 2000b, p47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
& the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adomo, the aura of the original armwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea- to down of layers of imitations; to Adorno, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
wad Ikatot Adumma. In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute Of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to contings working in
New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, run by Paul Lazars-
fel. Adored, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although he later claimed that be did mot know what a “radia project”
Lagarsteld loghed forward to working with Adorno, whom be knew to be an expert on music, Adorn
wrote for the Project's journal in 194), reiterating his position that radio was only an image of a live perfor-
mance, In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio industry that the mediun wus bringing serlous music
to the masses (Wippershaus, 1994, p, 243). While working at the Princeton Radio Research Project Adomo
became shocked at the degree to which culture had become commercialized jn the United States,
