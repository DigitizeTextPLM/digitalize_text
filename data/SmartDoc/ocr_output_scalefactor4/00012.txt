A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. Itis the social part of
language, itis essentially a collective contract which one must accep! in its entirety if one
wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming fram a single individual and is consequently a social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual act and not to & pure

creation. (Barthes, 1957, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system inte two parts, thee:
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For axamipla, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the extemal forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the atiual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified, "I propase to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image reapeclively by signified fsignifié) and
gignifier (significant), the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the oppesition that sepa-
