the formation of public opinion

In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being ea
manipulated, Remays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which
can be molded st will or dictated ta ‘Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) etnies Gite ele

made amicable and mutually beneficial. [t must explain itself, its aims, ite objectives, to the

public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 66)

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
tanipulate the public through propaganda, Bernaye presents public relations as a too] that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays,
1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognises the power of
society, but still aleo claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernaye (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in feneral, public relations 16 important because 1! helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others
to exert Lead in 1 ‘ing conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others
and to persuade or suggest courses of action (p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it is not in auch blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists euch a8

Lippmann amd Ellul tended to disagree with this point.
