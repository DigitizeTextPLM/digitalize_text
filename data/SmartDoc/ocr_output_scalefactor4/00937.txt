I, EARLY INFLUENCES

Therefore uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication.
The following theorists explore how communication can be a vehicle individuals utilize to reduce
uncertainly.

1 Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication.
‘The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology atthe University of lowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin, Lewin,
one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a sub-
stantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts [nsti-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
(Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developer
Lewin’s theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging field of in-
terpersonal communication and on the development of URT, Festinger is best known for the theories
of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison, Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted to
explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed CDT
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). CDT allows for three
relationships ta occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equi-
librium with each other: a dissonant relationship, in which copnilions are in competition with cach
other: and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another
(West & Turner, 2000), Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of arousal and dis-
comfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to
feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluote the self, the individual
usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to the self. This need for social comparison can
result in conformity pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, MM). Berger and Calabrese (1975) related so-
cial comparison to URT by stating that “Festinger has sugeested that persons seek out similar others
whe are proximate when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of
thelr behavior and/or opinions in é particular situation” (p. 107). Festinger received the Distinguished
Seientist award of the American Psychological Assoclation and the Distinguished Senior Scientist
Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger’s legacy is significant, and
his theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research, Aronson (in
Festinger. (980) stated, “It was in this eri that Lean Festinger invented and developed his theary of
cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, social paychology has mot heen the same since (p, 3).

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1983)

Frits Hetder comed his doctorate if philosophy from the Unteersity of Gear, During fits tiene in
Europe, Heider worked with amany eRawicd peychologiets such as Wolfgang Kohler Mow Meribeioner
ana! Keet Lewin, Eleider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin a3 a Substantial impaoer on his life: “1 want
to pay tribwic to Levin stimulating influence, which has affected much of my thinking and which is
till strong even in this book, although it dees not derive dircecly from his work" (Heider, 1058, pe

viii. In 1924, Heider moved ta the United States to work at Smith College and Later the University af

Kansas where he warked for the remalnder of his life (Ash, 2000).
