1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified aa an impectant construct, necessary to the study of commnu-
nication, ft would be bemelicial po lorcw when the concept originated, aed how it has been defined
and studied. Cine way tn consider uncertainty is through the cheoretical framework of information
theory. Shannen and Weaver (1949) propemed that uncertainty existed ie a given sineation wien there
id high amount of possible alematives and the probability of their event was relatively ecpoal,
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainny to the transmissiom of messages, Gur their work
glen contributed to the development of WRT. Berger and Calabrese (1575) adopted concepts from the
information theorists as well as Heider (1958) research in attibotion. Barger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept af uncertainty to fit interpersonal communicator by lining uncemalnry a5
the “number of aleemative ways in which each interactant might behave" {p. LOO) The greater the
level of umcertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance indivadaals will be able to pre-
dict behaviors and occurrences. During interactions individuals are not only faced ‘with problems of
predicting present are] past behaviors, but aloo explaining wh} partners behave or believe in the ay
