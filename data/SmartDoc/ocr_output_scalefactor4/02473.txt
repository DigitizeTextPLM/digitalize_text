division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did

the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on fle and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were inatead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
