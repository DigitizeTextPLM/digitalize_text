1. NEEDS AND GRATIAICATIONS

1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach emphasites motives and the sell-perceived needs of audience mem-
bers. Blumlerand Katz (1974) concluded that diferent people can use the same communication mes.
sage for very different purposes. The same media content may gratty different needs for different

individuals. There is nat anh) one way that people uses media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons
for using the media as there are media users (Blurnler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and
education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet thew
needs, That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and Bratificatans
for using different media. MoQuail, Rumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person
interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: etcape fram routine or
problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationship: companionshia; social utility; (3) Persanal
identity: seit referer

ce: reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance [farms af informa
tion seeking).
