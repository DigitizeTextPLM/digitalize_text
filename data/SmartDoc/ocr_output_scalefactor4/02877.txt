an individual act of selection and actualization, The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a vitw fo expressing his parsonal theught. It is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual act and not to a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-1 5)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language sysiem inte tes parts, the

signified ard the signifier. The sagnified ig a concepl oF meaning which is expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Kerean are the external forma expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the aiqnified. “| propose fo retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concent and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from each ather and from the whole of which they are parte" (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis
fed), p. 37). The comespondence of the conceptimeaning to the external form is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary reiation. It is not the inevitable internal relation but the difference
between the signa that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1950) argues that "language does
not reflact a pre-existant and extemal reality of independent objects, but consimicts meaning from
within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences”. According to Saussure, "meaning
is produced through @ process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the Syntagmatic
(e.g. a sentence} and the paradigmatic (e.g., synonym), organized into a signifying system” (Barker,
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the follow-
ing sentence: "| went to a theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence is established through the
linear combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as | theater, my, and girlfriend = Be
substitubed for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as “She went to a Setar with Fear = u
