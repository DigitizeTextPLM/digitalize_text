Propaganda that Laswell was examining wis actually being writen by Lippmann himself

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was « prominent scholar i the area of propaganda newearch. He focused on
condocting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, undeestanding the content of propagatala,
and discovering the effect of peopagandaon the mass audience (Rogers, 1543), Lasswell is-credined with creating
the mass comavunication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content asalpsis can be
defined as, “the investigation of communication sunsages hy categorizing message contem into -classificacions
in otder (0 measure certain variables” (Rogers, 1994), in an essay entitled “Coments of Communication,”
Lasswell (1945) explains that a consent analysis shoobd take into account the frequency with which cerain
symbols appear in a merisage. the direction im which the symbols iry oo perseade the audience's opinion, and
ihe intersry of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Laswell (1946) aim to
achieve the Boal of understanding the “airear of influence that pans [rom contra to content aed [rom oonien
to audience” (p. Tl).

This method of consent analysis is tied sorongly oo Lanewell (1953) early definicion of commeanication which
sated, Who says what in which channel in whom and with what effect" (p. B4. Comer analysis was eren-
ally the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to-do.a lot od work within this area during the
remaincker of his carer,

Aside from andersianding the consent of penpagasda, Lasswell wat also interested in how propaganda could
shape problic opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Laswwell was parcicelarly
interested in examining the olfeces of the mecha in creating public opinion within « democratic apstem. [in thes
way, Laswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented po them,
and albus apprekencive in accept it, Hinsever, i is sill thet infeernation that is affecting their decisions within
dhe democratic syslem, and is being presented co them by the government. This ts an inkietsling way of Viewing
ihe power of the media that is somewbet similar so Lippman thearies
