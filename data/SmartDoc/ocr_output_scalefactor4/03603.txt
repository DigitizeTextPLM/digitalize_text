18 thought on the culture industry, For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture

in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film,
Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in apposition ta
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 131).

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to
other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609), Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a svstem of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent: (Alway, 1995, P 83). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose muiaiz objectives were to
maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.
Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertamment agpects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination soca
(Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, it is difficult: in Marcuses argument cite culture
or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distingu ae mass
media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the dhe rats pe der
