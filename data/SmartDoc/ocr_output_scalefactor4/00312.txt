J, WEEDS AND GRATIFRCATIONS

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study of Katz, Blumler, and Georevich in 1974 as follones.
They provide 4 franewerk for understanding the correlation between media and audiences:

1, The sadienoe is conned as ative. Le, an impociam part of of mass media use is
assumed to be goal oriented ... pamerns of media use are shaped by more or leas
definiie expectations of what certain kind ef coment have bo offer the aodience
mem ber,

. inthe mans communication process mach initiative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a sirong limitation on
theorizing abour any form of straight-line effect of media content on attinedes and
behavior.

The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
TSS COMIMUNIcanion constiite but a segment of the wider range of human neds,
and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media comsamnp-
Hon cemainly varies,

. Methedolagically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from dia sapplied by individual audience members themselves- ie. people
are sufficiently sell-aware to be abe to report their interests ane nvetives im
Ppartiqular cases, of af least to recogmize them when confronted with them im an
intelligible amd familiar verbal formulation.

Vale fodements aboul Ore culdaral syenificance of mass commamicalion should be
suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms. (p. 15-17)

Ts addition, Kar, Blumler, and Gurevitch also conimentiod that, although previous researches ca
gratifications detected diverse gracifications that amract peopée on the media, they did not address the
connections between these gralifications (Katz et al, 197dap They suggested thal uses and gratifi-
cations research cancer With following aspects; “(0) Uhe social and the powchokogical ariging of (2)
needs which generate (4) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources: which lead to (5) dif-
ferential eqposune [or engaging in other activities), resulting in (6) need gratification and (7) other
Consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones" (Katz et al., 197d4b, p. 20). The studies of Katz amd
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of brailding the uses and gratification’ approach. Since
then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended, The current status of uses and
gratifications is stil) based an Kare’s first analysis, particularly a5 new media forms have emerged in
such an electronic infeemarion age when people haw nore options of media use.

1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses and pratifications approach emphasines motives and the self-perceived needs of aodience mem-
bers. Blumer and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication enes-
sage for very different purposes, The same media coment may gratify different needs for different
individuals. There is mot only one way that people uses media. Conmarily, there are as many reason
for using the media as there are media users (Blumer & Kate, 1574).

Basic needs, socte! situotian, od ihe individuals background, such o¢ experience, interests, and
education, offer people k (ders coud whet they wont from medio and which medio best meet their
need. That if, qedience mesohers ane gwen of and can store their own motives amd gratifications
for using different medio. Metjuoi!, Afumeler, ond Brown (25172) proposed a model of “media-person
interoctians” to chessify four important media grotificutians:
