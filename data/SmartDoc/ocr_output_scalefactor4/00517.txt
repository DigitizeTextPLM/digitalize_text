1.1 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing peopaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In
fact, mach of the peopaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being wrimen by Lippmann himself
(Rogers, [RH).
Harold Lacewell (L002-1978) was & prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused an
both quantitative and quilitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda,
and discovering the effect of propaganda om the mass audience (Rogers, EM) Lasswell is credited with cresting
ihe mass commenication peocedure of coment analysis (Rogers, 194) Generally, content analysis can be
defined as, *...the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classifications
in cotler bo measure Certain variables” (Riegers, 1564). Im an essay entitled “Contents of Communicatan,”
Lanawell (0546) explains that a coment analysis should take into account the frequency with which cemain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols ery oo persuade the audience's opinion, and
te intensity of the symbois used. By understanding the coment of the mestape, Lesewell (1946) ams te
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that rons from control to contest and from cosient
toaudience” (jp. 74).

Ths tethed of content analysis i tied strongly to Lasswrell (1953) early definition of communication which
sated, Whe says what in which channel to whom and with what effects” (p. 4). Connem analysis was essen
