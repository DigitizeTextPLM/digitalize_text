4 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked tha first real appearance of the idea of the
cuhure industry outside of a German context. In the years since there have been nucet
nut criticisma of the text, nol least since Adamo made sweeping generalizations about "he
commedified and fatishized character cf all cultural goods” (Cook, 1958, p. 413). For the
ganeraly sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adarno erred in nat discussing the processes of cul-
qural preduction, and faited to examine the culbure industry's economic depandence on Gener
business secors, including marketing and adwertsing (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, bath Adorno and Marcuse cverestimaled Ine dominant ideckegy, be-
lieving that “capitals! society languisnes in the grip of an all-parvasne rfeaton” (Eagleton,
1891, o. 46). Stil, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values ard beehe: fe.
among appressed peogles in sociely has some part to play in ihe reproduction of the syS-
tem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1997, p. 38). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adomes idea
of a culture industry was hiviorically limited since ihe society ihal developed in the 16806
and 1970s with new media went beyond the culbural possibilities available during the 1406.
‘hile the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial oct
efies bohween 1820 and 1970, trying to wee # today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahi,
1995, p. 146-98), Thus, for a some crifics, the value of the dea of the culture indusiry would
appear to be merely hestoncal, if they in fact conceded that it had ary value at all.

Thus for some cries modernist works would be counteracting farces against the dominant
ideology. Ag nofed in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case that the
dominant declogy can co-opt modernist works for its own ends, The idea of the culture
indusing has had an importance in orilical theory nce ile appearance in the 140s, in that
it has lad to though about the role of mass communications in telabon to ideology, are
hance, society, Since Adorno made sweeping generalizamane about the impact af the eulture
industry, and since he did not systemalically explore how the cullune industry operated, it has
been generally eagy for some to disiress the idea of a cuRure industry. It is nonetheless ihe
case thal motion pictures are stil made by large companies and that their movies largely raly
on formulaic plots. [tig also the case thal radha is increasingly conbrolied by a small numer
af compares, which tend to impose restrictions on how stations operate. As a broadcast
medium, tolevision is very much related to bath radio and film, and shares with them qualities
