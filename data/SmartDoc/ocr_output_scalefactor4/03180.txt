State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force, Interestingly,
in 1966, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea. :
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously
mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was

According to Rogers (19), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu-
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a aocial system. An Innovation
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu-
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-C-R-E
(e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this S-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be

interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(3) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, “Time vaniable
is @ YEry important factor, According to Rogers (1993), time variable is involved in diffusion in {1}
the innovation-devision process; (2) innowativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion msearch hav attempted to explain the variables
that inflvence how and why users and audience adapta new information medium, such as the Internet,

theory nor enly can apply to practical things, but also can be related to digital divide,
‘ There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
{lh lranevietirs (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)

Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional)" (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined

this term as “the degre: to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other

members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure | shows the relationships between ty

af adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these cate PES

follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped, Source by woew2. asd rey Pi ee
