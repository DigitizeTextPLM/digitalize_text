1.100 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Laswell was undertaking empirical analyse: of propaganda. In
fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being writen by Lippmaan hime
(Reagers. L954.

Harold Laswell (002.1978) was a prominem scholar in che area of propaganda research. He focused on
condecting buh quantiulive and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the coment of propaganda.
and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass aodbence (Rogers, 19540), Lasserell is cemdined with comating,
the Mass CaMmUnication poocedere of content analysis (Rogers, 14. Generally, content anahds can be
defined as, “the investigation of communication messages by calegorizing meesage content into classificarons
in coder te meawart certain wariables” (Reger, 1994) In an essay ented “Contents of Communication,”
Lasswell (1486) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which cermin
symbol apptar ina missage, the dinsction in which the symbols oy io persuade the audience's opinion, ane
the imensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of dhe message, Lasswell (1545) aime te

achieve the: geal of undersanding the “stream of influence that rons. from coninal te conan and from content
tr aandionce” fp, 74)

This method of coment analysis is tied strongly to Lawewell (1953) early defininon of communication which
sted, “Who says whan in which channel m whom and with whet effects” (p. 84). Comentanalysis was essen-
lially dhe says whan pare of dis defiedtion, and Laswell went on oo do a bot of work within this area dering the

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in hin propaganda could
shape public opineon, This desl primarily with underunding the effec of the media. Lasswelll wae particularly
imerested in examining, the effects of the media im creating public opinion within a democratic sysiem. In this
way, Lasawell has. creaned a cyche, whereby the public is limmed in die information that is poeseried in ther,

jhe democralic system, and is being peesemed co chem by the government. This is an interesting way od viewing,
ihe peweer of dhe micdia thac is somewhar similar oo Lappmann’s theories.

1.2 Edward Bernays (1891-1996)

At approsimately Ue dame time that Lippmann and Laeowelll wen examining public opinion and propaganda,
Etheard Brerears (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and poblic opinion, Bernas (1928)
defines propaganda a, a consiment, enduring effort ie creave or shape events to influence the relations of a
peblic w an enmerprise, idea, or greep Cp. 25). Conary to other propagenda theorists, Remays recognizes
thal propaganda can be either benelichal of harmful se the poblic. Tt can help ipdividuals decide what to thiak
about or alter the opinices of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial 1 sockety’s functioning as a whobe.
Bemays sales, “We are govemed, our mime ant melded. our tases formed, our ideas suggested. largely by
men we howe never heard of... Vast oumbers of human beings mast coopera im this manner if they are in live
ingetlser as a-smomihly functioning sockery (p. 4h

Based on these ideas that the public opieion can be malified, and that sock shaping i a tesoeitary part of
sockets, Bremayss precsued his work inthe field of putlicreations. “Public relasons is the atiemps, by information,
peruadion, and adjesiment, to engineer public suppor for an activity, cause, moverneed, of ealiluton” (Herreys,
1565, p. 3). In che Enwniecring of Gonseor, Bernas (1955) foes out ibe framerork for understordiag met public

campaign is adjustment of the campaign or the areudes of varus groupe in society, gathering information

Recrays! theories represent a sep forward for mass communication theory. They move away from more
cypical presereations of “hil-or-miss propaganda.” and move ioevard a deeper
