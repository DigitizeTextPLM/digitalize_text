In the Mass communication process much initiative in linking need ratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on

The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by

mass Communication constitute but a@ segment of the wider range of human needs,

and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consump-
Hon certainly varies

- Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- Le., people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in
particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms. (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous researches on
oratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people on the media, they did not address the
connections between these gratifications (Katz et al., 1974a). They suggested that uses and gratifi-
