1, NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows.

Five basic assumptions were stated ina study edia and audiences:

They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between m

1. The audience is conceived as active, i.e., an important part of of mass media use is
assumed to be goal oriented ... pattems of media use are shaped by more or less
definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience
member.

2. Inthe mass communication process much initiative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on
theerizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and

behavior.

4, The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
mass communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs,
and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consump-
tion certainly varles.

4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- ie., people
are sutticiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in
particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

Value jodements about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms, (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumer, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous researches on
gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract peaple on the media, they did not address the
connections between these gratifications (Katz et al., 1974a). They suggested that uses and gratifi-
cations research concern with following aspects: “(1) the social and the psychological origins of (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead te (5) cif-
ferential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in (6) need gratification and (7) other
consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones™ (Katz et al., 19?4b, p. 20). The studies of Karz and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the uses and gratifications approach. Since
then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The current slatus of uses and
gratifications is still based on Katz's first analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in
such an electronic information age when people have more options of media use.
