interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual’s adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variable
is a Very important factor, According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables
that influence how and why users and audience adopt a new information medium, such as the Internet,
According to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even though in the
past the individual is usually the unit of analysis, Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in
adopting new media because new media are interactive fools and thus are required by many users to
gain efficiency. That is, the more people use, the mare people get benefits. Jn this sense, allffierion
theory not only can apply fo practic al things, but also can be related to digitar divide,

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to [nnovativencss:
“1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), 4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional) (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-1 il Roget TOTS
