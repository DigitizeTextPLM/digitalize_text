it ls well accepted that communication theories Have developed through the realms of psychology and s0-
ciology over the past 100 years, With illumed by valuable ideas as well as exploring mare untilled fields in these
two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding media, As a sub-tradition of
media effects research, uses and gratifications approach is suggested to be originally stemmed from a func-
tionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional theory
On communication agrees with media's effects towards people. For example, a model often used in the the-
ory, the Hygedermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential
effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information inte the consciousness of the masses” [Watson & Hill 1997, p.
105). Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s te the 1940s. After that, a shift
which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses
and gratificatians approach,

The exploration of gratification: that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as
empirical mass communication research itself (hocuail, 1983). Dating back to the 19405, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such a5 soap operas and quizzes, as well
a5 daily newspaper (Lazrsteld & Stanton, 1944, 1949: Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1543; etc.). In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium
itself (Katz et al, L974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice,
support, or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (144) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 19705 when television has grown
Up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one al the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and a3 2 communication ragcarcher, He received his Ph.D. in 5o0-
ciology in 1956 fram Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1962. Curing
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem, In the late 1960, invited by the Government of lerael, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication fram the 1970s ta2990s (UPENN, 2001). In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its

i olars program for postdoctoral study,

i eo in ats ian is Paul Lavarsfeld, whois one of the pioneers of gratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced impartant outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theory model, Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
nation that people ute the media to their benefit. Ina study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (2973), a subject
which is known as the uses and gratificatians research were explored. They viewed the mass media as Bee
by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with nia a9 te eee media te
their needs more readily than the media overpower them [Katz, Gurevitch andl Haas, 1973]. ve

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published a callection of exsays on gratifications in 1974 w i
were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication. They took a more hurnanistic approach ta looking at media

sees cummest that media users seek out a medium saurce that best fulfils the needs of the user and
the ‘ ae alent choices to satisly their need. (Blumler & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that media
served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission for bath society

and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974).
