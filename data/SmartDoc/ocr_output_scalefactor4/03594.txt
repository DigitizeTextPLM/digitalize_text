1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 197 ish-
eid ae a 2 lieth Lela first real appearance of the idea of the
ous critici fth | . In the years since there have been numer-
isms 0 the text, not least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about “the

commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adomo erred in not discussing the processes of cul
tural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

; For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, be-
lieving that “capitalist society lang uishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton,
4991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton eonceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the raproduction of the sys-
tem as a whole” (Eagleton, 4991, p. 36). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adamo's idea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in tne 1960s
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1940s.
While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial sact-
eties between 1920 and 4970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl,
4995, p. 146-48). Thus, for a some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry would
appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value at all.

Thus for some critics modernist works would be cou nteracting forces against the dominant
ideology. As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case that the
dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of the culture
industry has had an importance in critical theory since its appearance In the 1540s, In sie
it has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation to SS ate
hence, society. Since Adora made sweeping generalizations about the impact of the cull!
