Ute exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media ig almost as old as
empirical mass Communication research itself (McQuail, 1983). Dating back ta the 1910s, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radia programmes, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well
as daily newspaper (Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1942; etc.). In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium
itself (Ratz et al., 19746). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice,
SUpport, or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944: Wanner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, hewspaper was alga discovered ta be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (194.4) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1370s when tetevision has grown
