itis well accepted that communication theories have developed through the realms of psychology and so-
ciology over the past 100 years. With illumed by valuable ideas as well as exploring more untilled fields in these
two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding media. As a sub-tradition of
media effects research, uses and gratifications approach is suggested to be originally stemmed from a func-
tionalist paradigm in the sacial sciences [Blumler & Katz, 1974]. To some extent, however, functional theory
on communication agrees with media's eects towards people, Far example, a model often used in the the-
ory, the Hypadermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential
effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information into the consciousness of the masses” [Watson & Hill 1997, p.
105), Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the LM0s. After that, a shift
which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses
and gratihcations approach,

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as
empirical mass communication research itself (Mcthuail, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well
as daily newspaper (Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1548; etc). In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium
itself (Matz et al, 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with agvice,
support, of occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 148); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
af conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949]. For these diverse dimensions of usage

tatistaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevalling in the late 1950s fill 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher He recemed his Ph.D. in 50-
cidlogy in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the mext thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force changed
with the Introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about

broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s tol9S0s (UPENM, 2001). In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and alka directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Katz's mentor in Colurvbia University is Paul Lararsteld, whe it one of the ploneers of pratitications research.

Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
functianal theary model. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
notion that people use the media to thea benefit. lina study by Ratz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subpect
whichis known as the uses and gratifications research were explored. They viewed the mass media 43 a means
by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to
their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1974].

Along with colleague lay G. Blumer, Katz published a collection of essays on gratitications in 1974 which
were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication. They took a more humanistic approach to looking at media
use, They supmest that media users Seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the user and
they have alternate choices to satisty their need. (Blumler & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that media

served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission for both pOcieny
and individuals [Bhumlor and Kate, 1974),
