1 Defining Uncertainty

Since untertainny hes been identified as an important constnoct, necessary to the shady of commu-
nication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined
amd] studied, Oee way no consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1925) proposed that uncertainty existed ina given situation when there
was a high amount of possible alternatives and the poohabiliry of their event was relatively equal.
Shannea and Weaver plated this view of umcertaincy to ihe transmission of messages, bot their work
ales contributed to the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the
information theorists as well as Heider (1958) research im atiribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
eqqunded the concept of amcerainry 1 fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as
the “number of alternative ways in which each inperactant might behave" (p. 100). The greater the
devel of uncerainty thai exist in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to pre-
dict behaviors and occurences. During interactions individuals are not only faced with problems of
Predicting presen and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way
that they do, Berger and Bradec’s (1962) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexicy of this
process when they staeed: “Linceralny, hen, can stem from the large nuenber of alternative things
that a stranger can beliews or potentially say" Uncertainty plays a significant role when examining
relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational developmen, Uncertainty con
