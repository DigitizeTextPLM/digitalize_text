Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural linguistics.

bet i i¢ system and the variation
To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic sy

by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the old ain

of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the sig wel whic pp

it; a8 opposed to it, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language (Barthes ae,
p.13). Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimension. The mcrae 7
langue, is ihe social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized.

On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However,
itis considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the
shared convention, the structure

A} language ls therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of

language, itis essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if ome

wishes to communicate, itis Because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequenthy a social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution aind system, speech is essentially

an individual act of Selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code

of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought, It ig because speech is
Bnsenially @ combinative activity that it comesponds to and individual act and motto a pure
creation, (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, thee
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or Meaning which is expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which ig the extemal part of lang vage. For example, both the ward
dog in English of in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the Signed. "| propose to retain the ward sign (signe) to

Srsignate the whole and to replace conceg! and SOUNC-IMage respectively by signified (signifid) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of ind cating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959. in R. Innis
(ed). p. 37). The corrmspondenoe of the SOnGeptimeaning to the extemal fonm is not in the destined
