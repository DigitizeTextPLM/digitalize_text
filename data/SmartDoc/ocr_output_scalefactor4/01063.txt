1.2 Edward Bernays (1991-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda
Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays (1928)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of -
public te ain enterprise, idea, or group (p. 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bemays raonpmixse
