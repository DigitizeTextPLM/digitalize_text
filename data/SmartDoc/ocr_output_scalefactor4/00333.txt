That is, by sharing communication channels such as pet communication aE
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, $-M-C-R-E
(e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1905) mentioned, “this 5-M-C-R-E commu-
peti model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, “Time! variable
is a very important factor, According to Rogers (1995), tive variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inte
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables
that influence how and why users and audience adopt a new information medium. such as the internet.
