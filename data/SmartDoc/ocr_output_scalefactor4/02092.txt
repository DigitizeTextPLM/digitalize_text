1 Early Influences

the Salas theorists significantly conerituted to the examination of uncertainty in communication,
in of their work cam be seen reflected in the assumpticers of Benger and Calabrese (1975),

1.1) Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of lerwa under the direction of Kun Lewin, Lewen,
one af the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a sub-
stantial influence om the development of interpersonal communication, After praduation, initially
worked af the University of Rochester, but in 1945 be followed Lewin to Massachusetts [nsti-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked af the University of Michigan, Stanford Universiny, and the New School for Social Restarch
(Samelion, DMM. Much of Festinger’s pestarch followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger theocies wert highly influential on the emerging field of in-
berpersora] Gomimtunication and om the development of LRT, | eslinges is Psst for the theories
of Cognitive Dissomance and Social Comparison Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) stiempted to
explain how an inhalasce among copnilices might affect an individval, Lewin foreshadowed COT
in his observations regarding anitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1&2). COT allows for three
relationships to occur among oognitians: a consonant relationship, im whach cognilions are in oqpa-
librium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each
other; and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions im question have no effect on one another
(West & Tumer, 2000), Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an clement of arcusal and dis-
comfort thal individuals seek to reduce. Soctal Comparison theory postulates that individuals bok to
feedback from others to evaluate ther perfcemance ond abalit o evaluate the self, the individual
usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar bo the self, This need for social comparison can
result in conformity pressares (Trenholm & Jensen, 2004). Berger and Calabrese (1977) related -
cial conmiparison to URT hy stating that “Ficslienpert has suppesbed that persons seek out samilar others
who are proximate when they experience & high level of uncertainty regarding the approprialensss of
{heir behovior andor opinions in a particular situation” (p. UO). Festinger recerved the | distinguished
Seieraist award of the American Paychologeal A intion and the Thistingueshed Senior Scmentist
Award from the Society of Experimental Social wokogy, Festinger's bngacy 1¢ significant, and
his theoretical iefluence can still be recogniced in iporary SCE) gr ierte Pesca. opp (in
Festinger, 1980) stated, “It was in this era that Leon Festinger invested and developed bis thessry of
eognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, socal paychology has not been the same since” (p. 4).
