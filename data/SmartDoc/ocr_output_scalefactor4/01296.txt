Like many other structuralist scholars, Barihes was influenced by Saussure structural linguistics.

Te Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two vels. ihe systematic system and the variation
he tema actors. The former is called langue and the latler parole. Langue is the systematized set
conventions necessary te communication, indifferent to the material of tha signal which compose
itt, 48 opposed to it, speech (parole) is covers the puraly individual part of language" (Barihes, 1967,
p.13). Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimension. Tha structure leneal,
langue, is the social convention ar value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized.
On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level, However,

it ia considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the
shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values, It is the social part of
language, ft is essentially @ collective contract which ane must accept in its entirety if one
wishes to communicate. it is because a language is a system of contractual values that it
reaists the modifications coming fram a single individual and is consequently a social instl-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actuakzation. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view fo expressing his personal thought It is because speach is
essentially a combinative activity (hat it corresponds to and individual act and motte a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic lavel, Sausurre distinguishes the language system imino two parts, the
signified and the signifier The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the extemal part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the extemal forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. “| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (eagnifié) and
signifier (significant); the last two temms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and from tee whole of which they are parts” (Saussure, 1969, in R. lines
fed.), p. 37). The correspondence of the conceptimeaning to the external form is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is not ihe inevitable internal relation but the differance
between the signs that operates ihe signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that “language does
not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning fram

within itself through 2 series of conceptual and phonic differences”. According to Sauseure, "meaning

is produced through a process of selection and cornbination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic
(e.g. a sentence) and the paradigrnatic (e.g., synonyms), organized into a signifying system” (Barker,
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the follow-
ing sentence: “I went to a theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence is established through the
linear combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as | theater, my, and girlfriend can be
substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as “She went to a restaurant with her mother.
Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated only when
they are related to each other. "Crucially, signs do nat make sense by virtue of reference to antiies m
an independent object world, rather, they generate meaning by reference te each other. Vite rear
ing is understood as a social convention organized through the relations between signs” (Barker, C.,
2002, p. 29). “Itis cantral to Saussures argument that red is meaningful in retation to the difference
between red, green, amber, efc. These signs are then organized into a sequence which generates
meaning through the cultural conventions of thelr usage within a particular context.
