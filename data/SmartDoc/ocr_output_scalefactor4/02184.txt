an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the cade
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is beacause speech Is
essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual act and notte a pure

creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog, Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and te replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis
fed.), p. 37). The correspondence of the conceptimeaning to the external farm is not in the destined
rélation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is mot the inevitable internal relation but the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (19650) argues that “language does

not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning fram
within itself through @ seres of conceptual and phonic differences", According to Saussure, "meaning
is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic
(€.9. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.9.. synonyms), organized into a signifying system" (Barker,
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection Is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the follow:
ing sentence: “I went to a theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence is established through the
linear combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as | theater, my, and girlfriend can be
substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as "She went to @ restaurant with her mother."
Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated only wh ,
they are related to each other. “Crucially, signs do not make sense by virtue of reference to ida Dt
an independent object world; rather, they generate meaning by reference to each athe ete n
