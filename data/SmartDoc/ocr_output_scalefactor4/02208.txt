9 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed ta
other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent [Alway, 1995, p. 8&3). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were to
ideclogy that maintained that control

Echoing Adomo, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination funetions
(Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, it is difficult in Marcuses argument to separate culture
of tass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass
Mmeaia as entitles separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno
had done. In the end Marcuses analysis of society allowed for no opposition ace dearer
ideology, Marcuse wrote, “how can the administered individualswho have made their mutilation

into their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged scalelibe
themselves from themselves as well as from their masters? Haw i

vicious circle be broken? (Marcuse, 1991, p. 251). Given the pessimistic tone of the book
it is somewhat ironic that largely because of it he would be perceive ,
movernents of the 1980s in the U.S. and Germany that developed an oppositional stance
In spite of this, Marcuse maintained that he was a philosopher, and not AN activist Like of ' -
associated with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of the ide apes ie
