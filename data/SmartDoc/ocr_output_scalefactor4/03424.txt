Uses and Gratifications

1.1. Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media rasearch, The orginal
conception of the approach wae based on the research for explaining the greal appeal of
cenain media contents, The core question of such research ie: Why do people use media | | |
and whal do they use them for? (McQuail, 1983). There exists a basic idea in this approach: ka i
SLdienoe members know media content, and which media they can use to meet their meets.
in the mass communicalion prosees, used and grabficaiions approach puts the function of
linking need gratifications and media choice charly on the side of aucience members. It
suggests that people's needs influence whal media they would chooee, how they wee cor |
jain media and what gralifications the media give them, This approach differs from ofher
iheoretical perspectives in thal i regards audiences as active media users a6 opposed ta
passive receivers of information. In contrast to traditional media eects theanes which focus
on “whal media do to people” and assuene audienoss ane homogeneous, uses and grabfica-
fons approach is mone concermed with “what people do wilh media’ (Ratz, 1959). lt allows
audiences personal needa to use media and responds to the media, which determined by
their social and psychological background. Uses and grabiications approach alsa postulaled.
fhat the media compete with other information sources for audignce’s need datetaction (Katz
etal, 1974a). As beditional mage media and new mada continue bo provide people wilh a
wale range of media platforms and content, it is considered one of the most appropriate
perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be exposed to diferent.

The approach emphasizes audiences’ choice by assessing thar reasons for using
acertain media to the disregard of others, a well as the various gratifications obtained
from fhe media, based on individual social and paychological requiraments (Seven
& Tankard, 1997). Asa broader perspective amang communication repeareles, Hf pro-
