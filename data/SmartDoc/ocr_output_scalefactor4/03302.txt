CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public, and the necessity of atbention-generating propaganda in infiuencing
public opinion (Bernaye, 1955, p. Gornaye (1955) himself made a statement regarding his Phrase,
the engineering of consent, He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more
than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity and

propaganda {Bernayvs, 1055, pte] Furthermore, Bernavs theories also represent a different view ot

the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The pubbe is not an amorphous mase which
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays. 1928, p. G6). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idew
that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terme the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 6)

Bernave elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presente public relations as a tool that can be
teed to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader The objective-minded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it [Bernays,
1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, a5 he recogmimes the power of
eeciety. Wat still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
henefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations i important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
aul to persuade or suggest courses of action (p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of

people thought about. lt was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting point tor future research
in the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work of
Iyengar and Kinder, as well as McCombs and Shaw. Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in
this paper has been very important to the understanding of the media, the manipulation of the public,
and the formation of public opinion. W hile the theories of Lippmann, Lasewell, Berneays, and Ellul
