Already in the late
1990s Adome evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adommo debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in etiect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “lhe Work of Art inthe Age of Mechanical Reoroduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pn
mary problem for Adorno lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, sy mphonic works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduc ed on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adomo was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechani reproduction of music: “Torether
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adorno, 20016, p 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adorm, the aura of the original artwork was. the
essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the m echanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or [dea- to down of layers of imitations: to Agorno, mass
but the destruction of tne authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
