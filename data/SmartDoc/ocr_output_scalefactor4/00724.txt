1. CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

; : j da in influencing
Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in in

public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement seas his phrase,
the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful plannin, § sper
than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity
propaganda (Bernays, 14, p-22). Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent a different view of
the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea
that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial, Tt must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept [p. 66).

Betnays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
tanipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays,

1952, ». 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1 f52) writes of the
benefits of public relathons, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them

to understand the aociety of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,

to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,

and to persuade or suggest courses of action (p. 10). Uneler this framework, while manipulation of

the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ebi) vended to disagree with this point.
