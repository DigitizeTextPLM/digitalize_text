Rogers was born in Carroll, lowain 1931, He eamed his B.A, MLA., and Ph.D. degrees from Iowa
State University, For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Fae
In 1945, he worked on some family planning communication Projects in Korea. s

The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creat: applications of diffu-
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously
mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was
suffering from kidney disease. He died on Oebober 21, 24,

_ According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
15 an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
s10f Of imnovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu-
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful, Lasswell
(148) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five ports, S-M-C-R-E
(e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect}, Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this §-M-C-R-E commu-
ication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19), Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal of mass Communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variable
is & ¥ery important factor, According te Rogers (1993), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the inmovation-decision process; (2) innevativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption, Difficion msearch has attempted to explain the variables
that influence how and why users and audience adopt a new information mediue, swoh as the Internet,
deconding to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are isipertant even though te the
past the individual is wrwolly the unitof analysts, Also, critical sinst becomes an ii mportan! factor fr
adopting new media because new media are interactive tools and thus are required by many users fo
gain efficiency. That is, the more people wre, the more people get benefits, Jn this sense, diffiocion
fheory not only can apply te practical things, fut also con be related to digital divide.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
“1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185), Rogers defined
this teem as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories
follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped. Source by www2.gsu.eduwwwitr/docs/dif-
fusion! Figure 2 shows that an innovation would spread through society over various periods of time in
a -shaped curve. However, as noted above, different types of innovations (eg. the rate of tetracycline
adoption is faster than that of the hybrid seed com) cin have their own different rates in diffusion. Fig-

cepti(2.html When it comes to the process of innovation decisions, Rogers (1995) mentioned that
there are five stages.

L. Knowledge + or - (selective exposure or awareness of news)

2. Attitudes + or — (people have positive or negative attitude toward innovations)

3. Adoption (Decision): people decide to adept the innovalion

_ Implementation (regular or standard practice)

_ Confirmation {comparing and evaluating)
