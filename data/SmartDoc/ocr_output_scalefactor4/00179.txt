1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry"

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of he
culture industry outside of a German context. in the years since there have been numer:
oS critics of the text, not Imast since Adora made sweeping generalizations about “the
cammodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adome erred in net discussing the processes of cul-
tural preduction, and failed bo examine the cultura industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertsing (Coox, 1996, p. 48)
_ For Terry Eagleton. bath Adomo and Marcuse cverestimated the dominant ideology, be-
ligving that “capitals society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasee reihcatian” (Eagietan,
108, p. 46). Stil, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values ard beliets
among oppressed pecoles in society has some part io play in the reproduction of the ays-
tem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1951, p. 3). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adora idea
of a culture industry was historically lrniled, since the society that developed in the 19606
and 19706 avth new media went beyond the cultural posaibiliiies avedable during the 1940s.
hile the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theary for industrial soc-
lies between 1920 and 1970, trying ta use & today weakens its efectveness (Hohendanl
1995, p. 46-45). Thus. for a some crilics the value of ihe idea of he culture industry would
appear io be marely hisharecal, if they in fact conmoeded tat it had arry value af all.

Thus for aome cfitics modernist works would be counteracting forces against ihe dominaré
ideology. As noted in the example of Orson ‘Welles, however, if may be ihe cae that the
dominant deology can oo-fpt modernist works for itt can ends. The Wea of the culure
industry has had an importance ctilical iheary since its appearance in the 164s, im thet
it has led bo thought about ihe role of mass Communica&one In relation le ideolagy, amd
hence, society. Since Adome made sweeping genenalzaeans about the impact of the culture
industry, and since ne did nat systematically explone haw the culture industry operated. it has
been generally easy for some io dismias the Hed ofa culbune industry. (is morattaeieres the
