Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced b Saussure structural linguist

To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on bye levels, the waivers sysbem and the variate
by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole, Langue |e the systematized get
of conventions necessary to Communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which compose
it, 4 Opposed to it, Speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language" (Barthes, 1967,
p.13). Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic sysiem within the social dimension. The structure level,
langue, is the social convention orvalue shared through a society which is stabilized and standardined,
On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual lavel. However.

itis considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the
shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of
language. it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one
wishes te communicate. it is because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resiets the modifications coming fram a single individual and is consequently a social insti-
tuber, In contrast to language, which is both institutian and system, speach is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization, The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought itis because speech is

essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual act and not to a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Foousing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language sysiem into fwo paris, the
signified and the signifier. Tike signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the extemal part of language. For example, both ihe word
dog in English arin Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, beoomes the signified. “| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signiflé) and
signifier (significant): the last two tenms have the advantage of indicating ihe opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and trem the whole of which they are parts” (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis
fed.), p. 37). The correspondence of the conceptimeaning fo the external form is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbetrary relation. [tis not the inevitable internal relation but the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that "language does
net reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from

within iteelf through a series of conceptual and phonic differences”. According te Saussure, "meaning
is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, ithe syntagmatic
(e.g, a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g., synonyms), organized into a signifying system” (Barker,
2002, p. 29), As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection |s also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the follow:
ing sentence: “I went to a theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence is established through the
linear combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as | theater, my, and girffiand can be
substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as “She went te & restaurant with her motier.
Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated only when
they are related to each other. "Crucially, signs do not make sense by virtue of reference to entities in
an independent object world; rather, they generate meaning by reference to each her. Tie, maan-
ing is understood as 2 social convention organized through the relations. between Ba ia C.,
3002, p. 29). "It is central to Saussures argument that red is meaningful in relabon to the ifference
between red, green, amber, etc, These signs are then organized into a sequence which generates
meaning through the cultural conventions of their usage within a particular conbext.
