problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (19 74), based
on a general theory of human needs. He distinguis hed between two types of needs: cognitive anc
affective, Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus
“Internal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “erawth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A

(1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
put ther inte five categories:
