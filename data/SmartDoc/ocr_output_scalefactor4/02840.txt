Uses and Gratifications

4.1. Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media research, The original
conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of
certain media contents. The core question of such research is: Why do people usé media
and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1983). There exists a basic idea in this approach:
audience members know media content, and which media they can use to meet their needs.
In the mass communication process, uses and gratifications approach puts the funetion of
linking need gratifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience members. It
suggests that people's needs influence what media they would choose, how they use cer-

tain media and what gratifications the media give them, This approach differs from other

theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users as opposed to

passive receivers of information. In contrast to traditional media effects theories which focus
on “what media do to people’ and assume audiences are homogeneous, uses and gratifica-
tions approach is more concerned with “what people do with media” (Katz, 1959). It allows
audiences personal needs to use media and responds to the media, which determined by
their social and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates
that the media compete with other information sources for audience's need satisfaction (Katz
et al., 1974a). As traditional mass media and new media continue to provide people with a
wide range of media platforms and content, it is considered one of the most appropriate
perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be exposed to different. ;
The approach emphasizes audiences’ choice by assessing their reasons for using
acertain media to the disregard of others, as well as the various grat fications obtained
from the media, based on individual social and psychological requirements (Severin
ective among communication researches, it pro-
vides a fra cesses by which media participants seek
information or content selectively, commensurate with their needs and interests (Katz
at al., 1974a). Audience members then incorporate the content to fulfill their needs or
on tisty their interests (Lowery & Nablla, 1983)

4.2 Origin and History

i t munication theories have developed through the realms of psy-
a oes frase ah the past 100 years. With illumed by valuable ideas as wel as
hart more untilled fields in these two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher
conceptions of understanding media.
