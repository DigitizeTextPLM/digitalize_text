1 Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication.
The influence of their work can be seen reflected in ihe assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology atthe Universicy of lown under the direction af Runt Lewin. Lewin,
ome of the founders of social paychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a sub-
stantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduadion, imitially
worked at the University of Rochester, but in 145 he followed Lewin to Maxsachesetts Insti-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Croup [vnamies. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Seanford University, and the Mew School for Social Research
(Somelson, SHH. Ahech of Pestinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging field of in-
terpersonal communication and on the development of UBT. | wf the thecracs

iheir behavior andice opinions in a particular situation” (p, (07), Festinger received the Distinguished
Sclentiet award of the American Psychological Association and the Distingwished Senior Scientist
Award from the Society of Experimental Social Paychology. Festanger's legacy is sigeilicant, and
is theoretical influence can still be recognined in contemporary sceal science research. Aronson (in
Festinger, 1280) stated, “It was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of
cognitive disssnance, aed inimy opinion, social peychology hiss mot been che same since” Cp. 3h
