Uses and Gratifications

1.1 Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media research. The original
conception of tha approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of
certain media contents, The core question of such research is: Why do people use media
and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1983). There exists a basic idea in this approach:
audience members know media content, and which media they can use to meet their needs.
in the mass communication process, uses and gratifications approach puts the function of
linking need gratifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience members. It
suggests that people's needs influence what media they would choose, how they use cer-
tain media and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs from other
theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users as opposed to
passive receivers of information. In contrast to traditional media effects theories which focus
on “whal media do ta people” and assume audiences are homogeneous, uses and gratifica-

tlons approach is more concerned with “what people do with media” (Katz, 1959). [t allows

audiences personal needs to use media and responds to the media. which determined by

their social and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates

that ihe media compete with other information sources for audience's need satisfaction (Katz

etal. 1974a), As traditional mass media and new media continue to provide people with a

perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be exposed to different.
