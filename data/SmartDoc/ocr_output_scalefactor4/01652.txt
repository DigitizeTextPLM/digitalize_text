1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real Sppearance of the idea of the
cu ture industry outside of a German context, In the years since there have been numer
ous criticisms of the text not least since Adorno Madge sweeping generalizations about “the
commodified and fetishized character of all Cultural goods” (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adorno erred in net discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).
For Teny Eagleton, both Adorno and Ma

l ruse overestimated the dominant ideology, be-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all- pervasive reification” (Eagleton,

1991, p. 48). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and belief
among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys-
tem as a whole" (Eagleton, 1991, p. 34). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Aderno’s idea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the 1960s
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1540s,
While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial soci
eties between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl,
1995, p. 146-48). Thus, fora some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry would
appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value at all. ;
Thus for some critics modernist works would be counteracting forces against the dominant
ideology, As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case that the
dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of the culture
industry has had an importance in critical theory since its appearance in the: 1940s, in that
it has led te thought about the role of mass communications in relation 16 ideology, and
hence, society, Since Adome made sweeping generalizations about the impact of the culture
industry. and since he did not systematically explore how the culture industry Operated, it has
been generally easy for some to dismiss the idea of a culture industry. It is nonetheless the
case that motion pictures are still made by large companies and thal thelr movies largely rel
on formulaic plots. Itis also the case that radio is increasingly controlled by a sma ee
of companies, which tend to impose restrictions on how stations operate, As ab res
