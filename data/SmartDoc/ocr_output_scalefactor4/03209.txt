fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was One of the histarical expe
riences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the peaducton
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, BOL, p. 4B :

1930s, Benjamin and Adora debated mass culture, aince film and radio became the twa most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic exsay, “The Work of Art in the Age af Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pris
mary problem for Adomo lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in.a concert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard over the rodio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records, The result was inferior to the
original, and Adomo was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help ta make escape from the whole infantile miliew
impossible” (Adomo, DI01b, p. 47), While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adamo, the aura of the anginal artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity, To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea to down of layers of imitations; to Adamo, mass
production wat nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adem. In 1924 Max Horkheimer, who hod succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that eaabbed the Institute to continue working in
New York, ohivined a position for Adorno atthe Princeton Radio Research Project, ron by Paul Lazars-
feld. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although be later claimed that he did not know what a “radio project” was, For his part,
Lazarsfehl looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be an expert om music. Adormo
wrote for the Project's journal in 1941, reiterating his position that radio was only an image of a live perfor-
mance. In addition, he questianed the claim by the radio industry that the medium was bringing ae ;
