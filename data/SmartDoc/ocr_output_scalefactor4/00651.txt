1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a basle human functien in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the geal of reducing uncertainty. U'neer-
tainty Reduction theary (URT), accredited to Charles R. Berger.and Richard J, Calabrese (1973), recognized that
reducing uncertainhy was a central motive of communication. Through the development of WRT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research, Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One ofthe motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
is the aoquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 153). The study of information is basic
te all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the Geld of imlerpersonal communication URT places the role af communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1973) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
SOmmunicotion proosss, they have tended to employ social psychological theories as starting points” (p. 95%,
The research underhying the theany and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of inter-
personal communication research; with the development of VET, communication researchers began to look to

communication far theortes of ereater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social
aclenoss.
