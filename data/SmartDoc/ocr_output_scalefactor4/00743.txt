1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic assumptions were seated in.a spud
of Karz, Hlunaler i,
They provide rinmoych iw anLeaitigtiy eivdaaaeoree cee in 1974 as follows.

2 Inthe mass communication process mach initiative in linking need gratification and
fiedia choice lies with the #odience member. This places a strong limitation on

theorizing about any forn of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and
behavior.

4. The media compete with cher sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
Tass COMIMUNECAOn constitute bot a segenemt of the wider range of human needs,
and the degree to which they can be adequasely met through mass media consump-
tion certainly varies.

4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media ase can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselwes- Le., people
are sullicieetly sell-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in
particular casts, or at least to recognize then when confronted with them in am
intelligible and familiar verbal formealacion.

5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience orientations are explored on thelr own perms (p. 15-17)

In adinion, Kate, Blumer, and Gurevich also commented that, althoogh previous researches on
pralifications detected diverse gratlications that attract peaple on the ovedia, they did nod adiress the
onnections berween these pratifications (Katt #4 al., 18744). They suggested that uses and gratifi-

ferential exposure (or engaging im meer actrvities), resulting in (6) need gratificaniom and (7) other
consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones” (Race otal, 1974b, p. 20). The srudies of Kate aml
his colleagues led a theoretical foundadion of building the uses and gracifications approach, Since
