1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic assumptions wern simted in a study of Kate, Blumler, and Garevitch in 18174 as follows.
Chey provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media and audiences:

~The audience is conceived as active, (.e., an important pan of of mass media use is
assumed Io be goal oriented ... patiers of media use are shaped by more or bess
definite expectations af what certain kinds of content have oo affer the audience

media choice lies with the aodience member. This places a strong liminaGon on
theorizing about any born of straight-line effect of media coment on attitudes. and

The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction ‘The needs served by

Methodologically speaking, many of the goals af mass media wse car te derived

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevich also commented chat, althoagh previous researches On

his colleagues ladda theoretical foundatiog of bailing the uses and gratification: approach. Since
then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The current stabas cof tases and
