i. OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1 Other Propaganda Theorists

1.1 Harald Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of prapagankda. In
fact, much of the propaganda thar Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself
(Rogers, 1994).

Harald Lasswell (1902-1978) was prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on
conducting bath quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the conient af propaganda,
and discovering the effect af propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 194), Lasswell is credited with creating
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis car be
defined as, "...the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message coment into classifications
in order to measure certain variables" (Ragers, 19%), In an essay entitled "Contents of Communication,”
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear ina message, the direction in which the symbols try po persuade the audience’s opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the cantent of the message, Lasswell (1245) alms to
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that nuns from contral bo content and [rom combent
to audience” (p. 74).

This methexd of content analysis is thed strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definitian of communication which
stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what &ffects* (p. 44). Content analysis was esseo-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a bot of work within this area during the
remainder of his canser.

Aside from understanding the contentof propaganda, Lasswell wad also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the ettects of the media, Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system, In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is Limited in the infarmation that is presented to them,

and also apprebensive to accept it, However, it is still that information that is affecting their decisbons within
the democraric system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories.

12 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

Ad approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bermays (1491-115) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bermays (1928)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of a
public to an erlerpeise, idea, or group (p. 25). Comcary to other propaganda theorists, Bernays recognizes
that propaganda can be either beneficlal or barmful to the public, It can help individuals decide what to think
abour or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to society's functioning as a whole,
Bemiays states, “We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, aur ideas suggested, largely by
men we have never heard of. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manmer if they are to live
together as a smoothly functioning society (p. 9).

Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be modified, anc that such shaping is a necessary pam of
sociedy, Bermays pursued his work in the field of public relations. “Public relations is the attempt, by information,
persuasion, and adjustment, to engineer public support for an acthvity, cause, movement, or instirution’ (Bernays,
1955, p. 3), Jn the Engineering of Consent, Bernays (1955) lays out the framework for understanding the public
and developing a public relations campaign. Bernays (1955) claims that the key to a successful public relations
campaign is adjustment of the campalgn to the attitudes of various groups in society, gathering information
to effectively express an idea, and finally, utilizing persuasion to influence the public opinion in the intended
direction.
