THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in
rope. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative
Europe. The closest thing in Adernos experience to the advertising industry in the United States
was fascist propaganda (Jiger. 2004, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to hie experience with
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did
not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project

the work of the Princeton Hadio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop

the idea of the culture industry.

Recouse of the relationship between the Inatitute for Soctal Research and Columbia University,

Horkheimer, who hod already moved to California, could nof bring Adorno to the West Coast until

November 2947. When Adorno was finally able to relocate, he formed an expatriate comreumity that

included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hons Eisler, Thomas and Hemrich Mann, Alfred Deblin, and

These preconditionsAdomos interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the
relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important to an understanding of

his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother te present itself as art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology ba legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Aderne, 2002, p. G5). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordiat
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy |Hohendahl,
1995, p. 142). Examples of thisnot spec liv Adornowere the Hollywood production sysbem, or
the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songe were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkhemmer and Adorno,
2002, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p
106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the sysbem, and Adorno cited Qrson Welles
as an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would
allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately render ing it ineffectual

of social control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of economic
coercion ultimately meant the freedom to be the same |Horkheimer and Adomo, 2002, p. 136)
