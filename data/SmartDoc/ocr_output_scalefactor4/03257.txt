This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1953) banly detinition of communication which
stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" (p. 84). Content analysis was esen-
tally the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to doa lot of work within this area during the
remainder of his career.

Aside trom understanding the content of propaganda, Laswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media, Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion withln a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is [imited in the intormation that is presented to them,
and alsa apprehensive to accept it, However, it is still that information that is alfecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an lmwteresting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories
