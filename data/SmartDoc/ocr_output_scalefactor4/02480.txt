1) Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty bes been idendifed as an mmpertani consinuct, necessary to che shady of oomm-
ae en are fication, it would be beneficial oo kaow whes the concen originated, and how it he been defined
and studeed) One way to cormider uncertainty ts throgg the theoretical Gumework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaeer (1545) proposed that uncerainry exisved in a elven sitmacion when there
was @ logh amount of possible altermatives: aril the probabibey of heir everd wos relatively equal
Shanon and Weaver relaned this view of uncemainty 00 the transmission of meaages, bor their work
aisn coninbused in the developeeet of WAT. Berger and Calabrese: (1975) adepeed comoespts from the |
information theories: at well as Heider (1958) research in amribution. Berger aad Calabeese (2575)
expanded the concept of uncertainty tn fit inteqperemnal communication by detining unceruinty a
the “number of aneredive ways in which each imeractant might behave" (p. 100} The apeaner the
eve) of uncertainty that exists ea atugtion, the enaller the chance individuals will be able oo pre
dict behuveors and occurences. During inveractom individuals are not andy faced with prvblems of }
Predicting presear and past behavsors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe in che way
that they do. Berger and Aradac's (0982) definition of uciruinty highlighted the complesiry of this
process when hry slated: “Ueceraincy, then, can siem from the linge numer of alteeretive things
that a siranger cam believe or potenmalhr sey” Ulcertaingy plays a significant rok when examining
relationships. High evel of uncertainty can seeerely hihi relational development, Lcerraingy can
