Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research, He focused on
conducting bath quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda,
and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass. audience (Pogers, 1994). Lasswell is credited with creating
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Ragers, 1994), Generally, content analysis can be
defined as, "_..zhe investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content inta classificatines
in ofder to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994), In an essay entitled "Contents of Communication,”
Laswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take int account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's apinian, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the coment of the mescage, Lasswell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that mans frem cantred ta convent and from content
to audience’ (p. 74).

This method of convent analysis is thed strongly to Lasswell (1993) early definition of communication which
stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects” (p. 44). Content analysis was esien-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to doa lot of work within this area during the
remainder of his career ;

Aside fram understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media, Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public 65 Limited irs the information that is feos pier
