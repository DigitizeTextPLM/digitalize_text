Uncertainty Reduction

1.1. Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has heen a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Ciacer-
fointy Reduction theory (UIT), accredited ta Charles R. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development of URT, these: scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uincentinty
sesearch, Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty’ fp. 133) The study of information is basic
to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced thearetical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the role af communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the fleld of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1973) note; “When eammunication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theortes as S:arting poines" {p. 33).
The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of inter
personal communication research: with the develapment of URT, comenunicaran researchers began to lonk ba
communication for theories of greater understanding rather than thearetical approaches founded in other social
