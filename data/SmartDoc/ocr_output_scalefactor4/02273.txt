individuals. There is not only one way that people uses media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons
for using the media as there are media users (Blumer & Katz, 1974),

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and
education, affect people's ideas about what they want fram media and which media best meet their
needs, That is, audience members are aware of and can state their awn motives and gratifications
for using different media. McQuail, Blumer, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person
interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or
problems; emetional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal
identity: self reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance (forms of informa-
tion seeking}.

Another subdivided version ofthe audience's motivation was suggested by MeGuire (1974), based
ona general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus
“internal” goal orientation, and ernotion stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 differant types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. 4
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (MeGuire, 1974), Katz, Gurevitch and Haas
(1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
PUL them inte five categories:

L. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding:
2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;

3, Personal integrative needs, including creaibility, stability, status,

4. Socio! integrative needs, inciuding interacting with family and friends; and

5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.
Congruously, MeQuail’s (1983) classification of the following common reasons for media use:

* finding out about relevant events and conditions iin immediate surroundings, society and the
world

* seeking advice on practical matters or opinion and decision choices

* satistying curiosity and peneral interest

« learning; selteducation

* gaining a sense of security through knowledge

* finding reinforcement for personal values
* finding models of behavior
« identifying with valued others [in the media)
