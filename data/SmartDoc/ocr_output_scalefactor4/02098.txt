i. CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attentlon-generating propaganda in influencing
public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase,
the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning, And It is carefal planning more
than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hat or miss publicity ane
propaganda (Hernays, 1955, p22). Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent & different view af
the formation of public opinian. In eppasition ta Lippmann, who views the public as being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which
can be molded at will or dictated ta (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernaya (1928) offers the idea
that in attempting to influence the public, @ busineis must study what terms the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. GH).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as 4 tool that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objectiveminded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, of helps the public adjust to it (Bernays,
society, but atill also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is impartant becuase it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, ta know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforta being made by others,
and to persuade or suggest courses of action (p. 10). Under this framework, while Thanipulation of
the public is still posible, it is net in such blatant ignorance ef the public opinion. Theorists sth a8.
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conelusion; The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Bld, and Bernays are itportent for a number of
reasons. Based on the ideas of Ate predecessors, Lippmann wae able to bring attenhon fo fhe fact Moat
the puoblic is able to be influenced by the media. The work of Lippmana and hia colleagues has Jed to more
recent research that is meant fo help anderstand the influence of the media on the public. Throwgh the
work fyengar and Hinder, White, Lewin, and McCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensive understanding
af the media fas been developed. The public has new been mode aware various fiedia fenetions suck me
agenda-setting, gotekecping, and priming, end the potential effects that these techniques can have on
Leer Gndieoes.
The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the direct effects and limited effects
media models. Theorists such as Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
propaganda could directly influence the thought of the inasses. Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippmann
also noted that the media might not be influencing only thought, but may also be influencing what
people thought about, Tt wis this line of thinking that resulted in & starting polnt for future research
in the ares of the limited effects of the mexlia. Such limited effects were shown through the work of
Tyengar and Kinder, a well as MicCombs and Shaw. Overall, the Tesearch of the scholars discussed in
this paper has been very important ta the understanding of the media, the manipulation of the public,
and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Eljal
were formed years ago, they continue to help ws understand the society that surrounds us today.
