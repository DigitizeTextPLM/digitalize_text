I. RETURN TO GERMANY

1 Return to Germany

were published without their permission in 1949, Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing
themselves from their own work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the late
1940s the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises in 1951, Horkheimer
became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954 Adorno published an essay
entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of a study that had been done for the
Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner and others. In this essay Adorno
warned, rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed
of payebological control (Adorno, 2001a, p. 160). It was one of the few occasions in the 1950s
that Adormo would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments

of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape

his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture

in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 an The

Culture Industry Reconsidered, In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film,

Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition ta

the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p- 131).

2 Qne-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist souleby into a systematic context, as opposed to
other writers in the Frankfurt Scheol (Wiggershaus, 1904, p. 609). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial seclety ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass sotiety (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendeous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satished and quieseent {Alway, 1995, p. Aa}. The
entirety of society had become organized around am ideology whose main objectives were to
maintain secial control and continue to perpetuate the ideclogy that maintained that control.
Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination fictions
or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did met distinguish culture or mass
media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the sane Way that Adorno
had done. In the end Marcuses analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the deiminant
ideology. Marcuse wrote, "how can the administered individualewhe have made their mutilation
into their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged scaleliberate
themselves from themselves as well as from their masters? How is it even thinkable that the
vicious circle be broken? (Marcuse, 1991, p. 261). Given thie: pessimistic tone of the baak,
it is somewhat ironic that largely because of it he would be perceived as an icon for leftist
movements of the 1960s in the U.S. and Germany that developed an oppositional stance.
In spite of this, Marcuse maintained that he was a philosopher, and not an activist. Like others
associated with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of the idea that theory could be translated

work required too much revision [6 receive miss dissemination, The two 22 aaa
negotiate with the Fischer publishing house until 1969, and may have only agreed to repul

the work since pirate copies had already been disseminated by individuals.
