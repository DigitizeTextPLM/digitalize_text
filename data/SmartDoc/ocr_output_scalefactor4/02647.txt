Uses and Gratifications

41.1 Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media research, The onginal
conception of the approach was based on the research for explaming the great appeal of
certain media contents. The core question of such research ie: Why do people use media
and what de they wee them for? (McQuail, 1283). There existe a basic idea in this approach:
audience members know media content, and which media they can use to meet their needs.
in the mass communicalion prosess, used and gratifications approach puts the function of
linking néed gratifications and media choice clearly on the side of audianca members. It
suggests thal people's needs influence what média they would choose, how they ube cer-
tain media and what gratificalions ihe media give them. This approach differs from other
theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users as opposed ta
passive recetvers of information. in comiraat to radional media effects theories which focus
on “what media de lo people” and assume audiences are homogengous, uses and grabfica-
fons approach is more concerned wilh “what people ca wilh media” (Fal, 1959). It allows
audiences personal needs to use media and reaponds to the media, which determined by
ther social and psychological background. Uses and gralifications approach also postulales
jhat the media compete wilh alher information sources for audience's need satisfaction (Katz

e1 al. 1874a). As traditional mass media and new media continue te provide peaple wih a
wide range of media platforms and content, it is considered one of the mast appropriate
perspectives for investigating why audiences choose io be exposed to different.

The approach emphasizes audiences’ choice by assessing their masons for using

a cortain media fa the disregard of others, aa wailas the warous gnnivications obtained
from the media, based on individual social and psychological requirements (Severin

B Tankard, 1997). As a broader perspective among communication researches, it pro-
vides a framewor® for understanding the processes by which medi particinants seek
information or content seleetraly, commensurate with Uhr needs and intersects (Mate

etal, 1974). Audience mambers then incorporate fhe content to fall their reeds or
fo safety their inferasits (Lowery & Mahifa, 1582).
