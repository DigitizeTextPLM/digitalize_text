1 Needs and Gratifications

Wees and pratilications approach emphasizes motives and the sell-perceived needs af audience mem-
bers. Blumlerand Katz (1974) concluded that diferent people can use the same communication mes-
sage for very diferent purposes. The same media comtent may gratify diferent needs for different

indwiduals. There is not only one wary that people uses media. Cantrarily, there are as many reasons
for using the media as there are media users (Blumier & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such a5 experience, interests, ard
education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their

needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their oan motives and gratfications
for using diferent media. KicQuad, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “mece-persan

interactions” to classify four important media gratifications; (1) Diversion: escape from routine or
problems; emotional release: (7) Personal nelatanshigs: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal

identity: self reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and {4] Surveillance (fonmes of informa-
Tron seeking).

Anoher subdivided version of the audience's motivabon was suggested by MoGuere (1974), based

on 6 general theory of human meeds. He distinguished between tea types of needs; cagnetive and
attective, Then he added three Genersions: “actwe wersus “passive” initiatign, “eaternal” wercus

"internal goal arienmation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “preservatian” When charted,
these factors yield 16 diferent types of mobyabons which apply te media use (Figure Tp Figure 1. A
