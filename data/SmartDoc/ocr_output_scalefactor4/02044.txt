Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on

conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding he canter at
and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswell is cr ebiainics
che mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content a ee 7
defined as, ".,.the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message Conient td CE ea
in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled "Contents of Communication,
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency eal which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbels try to persuade the audience $ opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence that runs from control te content and from content
to audience” (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects” (p. #4). Content analysis was esscn-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the
remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of che media. Lasswell was particularly
interested In examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still that information that is aftecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories.

1.2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bermmays (1928)
defines propaganda is 2 ERDME ak enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of a
public to an enterprise, idea, or growp (p. 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bemays recognizes
that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public. Tt can help individuals decide what tw think
about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to society’s functioning as a whole
Bemays states, “We are govermed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely [=
men we have never heard of... Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are ta live
