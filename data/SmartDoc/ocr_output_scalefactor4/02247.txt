Site University, For ten years during the Korean War, he served in the US, Air Force. Interestingly,
in 1966, he worked on scene family planning communication projects in korea.

The book hes become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it crests appleations of diffue
sion theary in such fekds os geography, economics, paychokgy, political science, and, as previously
mentioned, comenunication. Rogers retined from University of New Mexico in DOM besa he was
waffering from kidney disease, He died on Cotober 21, 2005.

According to Rogers (Hi), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is Gomer
nicated through certain channels ower time among the members of a socal system. An Innovation

an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
siom of inngwations invalves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 405).

There are five different types of adopters im the diffusion process, according bo bnnvativeness
“(1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Magerity (skeplical), and (5) Laggards (tradisionaly" (Rog 05, pe. 13-165) Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier im adopting new idets than other
