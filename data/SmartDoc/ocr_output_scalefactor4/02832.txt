the mass communication procedure af content analysis (Ragers, L94). Generally, content analysis Cam
defined as, "the investigation of communication messages hy categorizing message content ino classificattons
in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled "Contents of Communication,
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take inta account the frequency with which ep
symbals appear in a message, the direction in whiels che symbols try 1 persuade ike audience's opinion, an
the intensity of the symbals used. By understanding the content of the messape, Lasswell (1946) aims to

achieve the goal of understanding the “stream af influence that ans from cantral ta content and from content

to audience” (p. 74). F
This method of content analysis is tled strangly to Lasswell (195°) early definition af communication which

remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was alsa interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This deals primarily with understanding the effects of the media, Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of che media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public ts limited in the information that is presented to them,
and alse apprehensive ta accept it, However, lt Is still that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is am interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s thearies.

12 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bemays (1691-1595) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion, Bernays (1928)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events Lo influence the relachons of a
public to am enterprise, idea, or group (p. 25), Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bermays recogmizes
that propaganda can be cither beneficial or harmful to the public. [t can help individuals decide what to think
about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to society's functioning asa whole,
Bermays states, “We are aoveroed, aur minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested. largely by
Ten we have never heard of. Weer cumbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live
together 25 a smoothly functioning society (p. 3). ;
Based on these ikleas that the public opinion can be modified, and that such shaping i :
society, Bernays pursued his work in the field of public relations. “Public relations is the iinet heal
persuasion, and adjustment, to engineer public support for an activity, cause, movement, or instituclon" (Bema =
1955, p, 3). Inthe Engineering of Consent, Bernays (1955) lays out the framework for understanding the. ay
