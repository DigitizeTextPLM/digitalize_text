that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, 1%s objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept {p. 66). ;

Bernays elaborates on these dens in Public Relation (1952). Rather than merely athempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations a8 4 tool that ean be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations

1952, p. 9). Bernave view of the public is aofter than that of Lippmann, 8 he recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that svanipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
henefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relathons is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade or suggest courses of action [p. 10}. Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public i still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion, Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippman, Laaewell, Ellul, and Bernaya are important for a umber of
reasons. Based on the ideas of kis predecessors, Lippmann eras oble to bring attention to the fact that
the public is able to be influenced by the media. The mork of Lippmann and Ais colleaques has led to more

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily te both the direct effects and limited effects
méixlia models, Theorists such as Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
propaganda could directly influenos the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, theorists such as lipenasia
also noted that the media might not be influencing only thought, but may also be influencing what
people thought about. [t was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting point for future Bt cs
in the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through th k
Tyengar and Kinder, as well as McCombs and Shaw. Overall, the research of the scholars di ae se
