strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part itt cultural developmenta
of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape
his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrobe of a universal pseudo-culture
in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered, In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies an Film,
Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 141).

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to
other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggerstians, 1994, p. 609). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse sevial contre! mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
wAuence that kept elements of society satished and quiescent [Alway, 1995, p. 83). The
entirety of soclety had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were bo
maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control

Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
ef mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions
(Marcuse, 1001, §. 8). However, it is difficult in Marcuses argument to separate culture
or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass
ideology, Marcuse wrote, "how can the administered individualswho have made their mutilation
into their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged scaleliberate
themselves from themselves as well as from their masters? How is it even thinkable that the
vicious circle be broken? (Marcuse, 1991, p. 251). Given the pessimistic tone of the book,
