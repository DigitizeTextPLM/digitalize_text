1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry"

The 1872 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
cunure induairy ouiside of a German contest. In the years since there have been numer:
bus Criticisms of the text, not leael since Adoma made sweeping ganeralizalions about “the
commodified and fetehized character of all culbural goods” (Cook, 1905, p 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adomo erred in not discussing the procetaes of cul-
tural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
butiness sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996p. 48)

For Terry Eagieten, both Adomo and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ieakogy. e-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all pervative reification’ (Eagleton,
1981, p. 46). Still, Eaghton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant vale and belets
among oppressed peoples in society has some pari to play i the reproduction af the By S-
jem as a whole” (Eagleion, 1991, p. 36). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adora Lh
of a culture industry was historically limited. since the society that developed in fre 19605
and 19706 with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1980s.
While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for indupinal soc
plies behween 1920 and 1970), trying bo use & today weakens its effectivenses (Hohendanl,
1995, p. 146-48). Thus, for a some cfitics, the value cof the idea of the culture industry would
appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value a all ;

Thus for some eritics modemistwarks would be counteracting fances against ihe daminan
ideology. As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case that the
dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for Its own ends. The idea of the oe
