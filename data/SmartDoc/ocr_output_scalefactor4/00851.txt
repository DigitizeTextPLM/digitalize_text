and studied. One way to comider uncertainty is thewugh the theoretical framework of information
theary. Shannos and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncemalnry existed ina given sinaation when there
was a high amount of possible alermatives amd the probability of their event was relatively equal
Shannen and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the Iransm Hf resseges, bart their works
also contritured to the development of WRT. Berger and (Calabrese adopied concepts from
infarmatkan theorists as well a3 Heider (1954) research in atiribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concep! of ancenainty ie fit interpersenal commnvanication by defining uncemainty as
the “number of alsernative ways in which each interactant might behave" ip. LMT). The greater the
level of uncertainty that exists in 4 situation, ihe smaller the chance individwals will be able to pre-
