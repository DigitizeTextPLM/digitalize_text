Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1962). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernaye presents public relations 25 4 tool that pias be

society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade or suggest courses of action (p. 10), Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such a3
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of
reasons. Based on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann was able to bring attention to the fact that
the public is able to be influenced by the media. The work af Lippmann and his colleagues has led to more
recent research that is meant to help understand the influence of the media on the public. Through the
work fyengar and Kinder, White, Lewin, and McCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensite understanding
of the media kas been deneloped. The public has now been mode aware various media functions such as
agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming, and the potential effects that these techniques con have on
