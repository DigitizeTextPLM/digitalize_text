and studied, One way to consider uncertainry is through the theoretical framework of informarice I
theory. Shannon and Weaver (151%) proposed that uncertainty existed ina given sinsation when there
wis a high amount of possitle alematves and the probability of their event was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, bur their work
alsa contributed to the development of UT. Berger and Calabrese (157) adopted concepts from the
