Focusing on the systematic level, Seusurre chstinguistes tne language system inte bwo parte the
signified and the signther. The signtted is a concept or mearing which is expressed through the form.
The form ig called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in Engieh of in Korean are the axiamal forms expressing the aciual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the corgect in question, becomes the signifies. “propos 1 retain the word aigr (signe) fa
