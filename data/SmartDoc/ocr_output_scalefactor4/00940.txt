According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu-
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
Is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
s10n of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p, 409),
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal Communication or mass commu-
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, 5-M-C-R-E
(e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-eftect}. Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this S-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) Message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(3) the effects can be individual’s adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, “Time variable
is a Very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables
that influence how and why users and audience adopt a new information medium, such as the Internet.
decording to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even though in the
past the individual is uswally the unit of analysis. Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in
adopting new media because new media are interactive tools and thus are required Oy many users to
gain efficiency. That is, the mare people use, the more peaple ger benefits. Jn this sense, diffusion
theory not only can apply to practical things, but alse carn be related ta digital divide
There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
“/1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4
Late Majority (skeptical), and (4) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185). Rogers detined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than otner
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 4). Figure | shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place an the adoption curve. Also, the Se Sees
