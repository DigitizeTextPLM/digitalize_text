Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has heen a strong foundation for Communic

research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange 15 & basic human A in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Uacer-
tainty Reduction theory (URT), accredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1 973), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development of LIRT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “Ome of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty" (p. 153). The study of information is basic
te all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the role of communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
sorese (1975) mole: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories a3 starting points” (p. 99).
The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of inter-
personal communication research; with the development of URL, communication researchers began to look to
communication for theores of ereaier understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social
SCIences.
