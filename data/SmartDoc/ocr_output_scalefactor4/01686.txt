Propaganda (Berays, 1955, p22). Furthermore, Bernaye theories also represent a different view of
the formation of public opinion. In oppasition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily
Thanipulated, Berney cautions agalmst this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which
cain be melded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernaye (1028) offers the iden
that in abtempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be
maddie amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explaln itself, its aims, ite objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 64),

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that tan he
wed to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations

1952, p. 9), Bernays view of the public is softer than that af Lippmann, a5 he recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is pessiile. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpaint af others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforta being made by others,
and to persuade or suggest courses of action (p. 1), Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it & not in such blatant lenorance nf the public opinion. Theorists such as
Lippanann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Goaewell, Eltul, and Bemags are important for a sumier af
reasons. Based on the ideos of hia predecessors, Lippmann was able to bring attention fo the fact that
the public is oble to be influenced hy the media, The work of Lippmann and his colleagwes has led to more
