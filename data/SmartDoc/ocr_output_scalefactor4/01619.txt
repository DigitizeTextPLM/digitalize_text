Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, ihe concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the development af communication theory. Information exchange is a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Uacer-
tainty Reduction theary (URT), eccredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J, Calabrese (1975), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central mative of communication. Through the development of WRT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning inkerpersonal Communication
is the acquisition of infermation with which to reduce uncerlainty” (p. 153). The study of information is basle
te all fields of communication, but tts relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the role of communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories as starting points” ip. 99).
The research underlying the theary and cfforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of inter-
personal communication research; with the development of URT, communication researchers began to look to
communication for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social
sclences,

1.2 The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Traditionally, communication has been viewed os an interdisciplinary fel Interpersonal communication is
most often linked to studies into language, social cognition, and social psychology, Prior to the 1460s, only a
modest amount af research was completed under the label of interpersonal communication. Heath and Bryant
P2000) marked this time as the origin of the field of interpersonal communication: “Particularly since 1960,
scholars adopied communication as the central term because they warned fo stu itor a significant and unigne
agpect Of human behavior” tp. $9). The 1960s produce sh that impacted the lopment of an in-
terpersanal field. Research in psychiatry examined personality and the influence of relationships, finding, that
psychiatric problems were not only a result of self problems, but a result of relational problems as well. Re-
search trends in humanistic psychology ard existentialiam inspired the idea that relationships could be improved
