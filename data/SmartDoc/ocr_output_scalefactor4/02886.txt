Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has
contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole, This chapter strives to focus
on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work
is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our
understanding of interpersonal processes.

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of commu:
Tiication, it would be beneficial to Know when the comcept originated, and bow it has been defined
and studied, One way te consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there
was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
also contributed to the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the
information theorists as well as Helder (1958) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as
the “number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave (p. 100). The greater the
level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the stodller the chance individuals will be able ta pre=
dict behaviors and occurrences. During interactions individuals are net only faced with problems of
predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why pariners behave or believe a the way
that they do. Berger and Bradac’s (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this
rocess when they stated: “Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things
fe @ stranger can believe or potentially say" Uncertainty plays a significant role sh examine
