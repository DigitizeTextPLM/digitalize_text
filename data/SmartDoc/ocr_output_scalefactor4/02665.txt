itis well accepted that communication theories have developed through the realms of psychology and so-
ciclogy over the past 100 years, With illumed by valuable ideas as well as exploring more untilled fields in these
rchers elicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding media. As a sub-tradition of

media effects research, uses and gratifications approach is suggested to be origin
tionalist paradigm in the 5

two disciplines, resea

ally stemmed from a func-

ocial sciences [Blumler & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional theory
on communication agrees with media's effects towards people.

For example, @ model often used in the the-
ory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential
effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information into the consciousness af the masses” (Watson & Hill 1997, p.
105). Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s te the 1940s. After that, a shift
which rediscovered the relationship between media and people gecurread and led to establishment of uses
and gratifications approach.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as
empirical mass communication research itself (MicCuail, 1922

}. Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio program

mes, such a6 Sap operas and quizzes, as well
as daily newspaper (Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc). fn these
studies, researchers discovered a list af functions served either by some specific content or by the mediurnt
itself [Kate et al., 19746). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice,
support, or occashons for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 194); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure to the dally routing [Berelson, 19445). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Hermog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Lises and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s tl 1970s when television has prawn
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed wihern it was redecovwered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on ude and gratifications research, Elihu Katz Is one of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to edtablishing the structure of the approach. ;

Elihu Katz i served both apa sociologist and a6 4 communication researcher. He received his PAG. ir Sa-

the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerugalem, in the late 1960, invited by the Goverment of israel, ee headed the task force charged
with the introduction af television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture are communication from the 1970s tal990s [UPENN, 2002). In
