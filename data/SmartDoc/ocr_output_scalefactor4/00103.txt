of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berekon, 1949), For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevalling in the late 1950s tll 1970s when television has grown
Up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach,

Elihu Katz is served both as a soctlogist and asa communication researcher, He received his Ph.D. in 5o-
tidloagy in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1953. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
aity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government of srael, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experiance bed to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s fo19906 (UPEMM, 2001), In
1792, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennaylvania, and ale directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Kate's mentor in Columbia University it Paul Lazarsfeld, whe i one of the pioneers of pratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratificatians with the
functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
notion that people use the media to their benefit, In a study by Katz, Gureviteh and Haas (1973), 8 subject
which is known as the uses and gratifications research were explored. They viewed the mass media as a means
by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that peeple bend the media to
thelr needs more readily than the media overpower therm (Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumer, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 which
were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication. They took a more hurnanistic approach te looking at media
use, They suggest that media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the user and
they have alternate choices to satisty their need. (Blumber & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that media
served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission for bath society

and individuals (Blumnler and Katz, 1974).
