1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion,
social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, bal-
ance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology,
played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider,
Kelley, and Hovland, By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction,
relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars
as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibawt. During the later part of the decade
and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger became popular
along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson.
Berger (2005) states; “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal comm research
agenda during the past two decades” (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus
on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as
a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically
focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized
that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).
Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has
contributed to the development of the field of communication asa whole. This chapter strives to focus
on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work
is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and ts central in our

understanding of interpersonal processes.

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since wncertainoy has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of commu-
nication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined
and studied. Ome way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed In a given situation when there
was a high amount of possible altematives and the probability of their event was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver celated this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
also contributed to the development of LRT, Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the
information theorists a5 well as Heider (1958) research in attnibution. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty a5
the “number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" fp. 100). The greater the
level of uncertainty that exiscs in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to pre-
dict behaviers and occurrences. During interactions individuals are mot only faced with probleme of
predicting present and past behaviors, bur also explaining why partners behave or believe in the way
that they do. Berger and Bradac’s (1582) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexing of this
process when they stated: “Uncertainty, then, can sem from the large number of alternative things
that a stranger can believe or potentially say” Uncertainty plays 4 significant role when examining
relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development. Uncertainty can
couge siness ond anxiety which con lead to low levels of communicator competence (West & Tumer,
TOMO). Incompetent communicators may not be able to develop relationships o may be too anxious
to engage in initial interactions. West and Tumer (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty caused
increased verbal and nonverbal behavior, increased levels of intimacy, and increased liking. In inter-
actlons individuals are expected to increase predictability with the goal that this will lead to the ability
to predict and explain whet will occur in future interactions. When high uncertainty exists it is often
difficult to reach this goal. Although individuals seek to recuce uncertaincy, high levels of certainey
and predictability can also inhibit 4 relationship. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “Too much certainty
and predictability can deaden a telationship:
