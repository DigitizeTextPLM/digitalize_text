Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-

abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theory, Information exchange is a basic human funetion in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. L’ncer-
tainty Reduction theary (URT), accredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (19/5), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development of IRT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research, Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal COMUIMLLITC ALTO
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty’ (p. 133). The study of information 1s base
te all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. WRT places the role of communication inte the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal c communication, Berger and Cal
abrese (1974) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories as starting points" (p. 99).
The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of inter-
personal communication research, with the development of URT, ¢ omimunication researchers began to look to

communication for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social
SClences

1.2 The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Traditionally, communication has been viewed as an interdisciplinary field. Interpersonal communication is
mest often linked to studies into language, social cognition, and social psychology. Prior to the 1960s, only a
modest amount of regearch was completed under the label of interpersonal communication. Heath and Bryant
(2000 marked this time as the origin of the field of interpersonal communication: “Particularly since 1960,
scholars adopted communication 2% the central term because they wanted fo siuay if a a sipnific oy ane unique
aspect of human behavior” (p. 59). The 1960s produced research that impacted the development of an in-

terpersonal field. Research in psychiatry examined personality and the influence of relationships, finding that

paychiatric problems were not only a result of self problems, but a result of relational problems as well. Re-

search trends in humanistic psychology and existentialism inspired the idea that relationships could be improved
