The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theary and it creats applications of diffu-
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously
mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was

suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005. is
According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation 1s commu-
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. ae
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The dist:
sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu-
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, §-M-C-R-E
(e.@., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this S-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variable
is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption, Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables
that influence how and why users and audience adopt anew information medium, such as the Internet.
According to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even though in the
past the individual is usually the unit of analysis. Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in
adopting new media because new media are interactive tools and thus are required by many users to
gain efficiency. That is, the more people use, the more people get benefits. In this sense, diffusion
theory not only can apply to practical things, but also can be related to digital divide,
There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
“(L) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majarity (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185), Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure | shows the relationships between
of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, the types

theses irs tee Process of innovation-decisions, Ropers (1995) mentioned that

1. Knowledge + or = (selective eEXPOSUTe OF awareness of news)

2. Altitudes + or — (people have positive or negative attitude toward innoy ations)

3. Adoption (Decision): people decide to adopt the innovation

- Implementation (regular or standard Practice}

- Confirmation (comparing and evaluating)
