1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study of Katz, Blumler, and ica epee follows.
They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between melia and audiences:

definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience

oad choice lies with nwt member, This places a strong limitation on
theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and
behavior.

. The media compete with other sources of need satkstaction. The needs served by
mass communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs,
and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consuimp-
tion certainly varies.

_ Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- Le., people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in
particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

. Value judgements about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms. (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gureviteh also commented that, although previous researches on
gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people on the media, they did not address the
connections between these pratifications (Katz et al. 1974a). They suggested that uses and gratifi-
cations research concem with following aspects: “(1) the social and the psychological origins of (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sowrces which lead to (5) dif-
ferential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in (6) need gratification and (7) other
consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones” (Katz et al., 1974b, p. 20). The studies of Katz and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the uses and gratifications approach. Since
then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended, The current status of uses and
gratifications is still based on Katz's first analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in
such an electronic information age when people have more options of media use,
