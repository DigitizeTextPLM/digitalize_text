1, OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1 Other Propaganda Theorists
1.1 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harald Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In
fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself
(Rogers, 1994).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on
conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda,
and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswell is credited with creating
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis can be
defined as, "...the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classifications
in order to measure certain variables" (Ropers, 1994). In an essay entitled "Contents of Communication,"
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis shauld take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols ty to persuade the audlence’s opinion, amd
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that runs from control to content and from content
to audience" (p. 74].

‘This methad of content analysis is tied strongly ta Lasawell (1953) early definition of communicatian which
stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" (p. 34), Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to doa lot of work within this area during the
remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was alse interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion, ‘This dealt primarily with understanding the effects ofthe media. Lasiwell was particularly
interested in examining, the effects of the media in creating public apinian within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and alse apprehensive to accept is. However, it is still that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to teem by the government. This is an interesting way af viewing.
the power of the media that bs somewhat similar to Lippmann’s thearies.

L2 Edward Bernays (191-1995)

Ad approsimately the same time that Lippmann and Laaswell were examining avblic opinion and propapanda,

Edward Bernays (1891-1996) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion, Bermays (1528)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effor to create or shape events to influence thr relations of a
public to an enterprise, idea, or group (p. 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bernays recognizes
that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful ta dee public, It can help individuals decide what to think
about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneticéal to society's functioning a3 a whole.
Bormays stares, “We are governed, our minds are molded, aur tastes formed, aur ideas suggested, largely by
men we have never heard of... Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are oo live
together as a smoothly functioning society (p. 4).

Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be modified, and that such shaping is a necessary part of
seciely, Hermays pursued bis wark inthe field of public relations. “Public relations is the attempe, by information,
persuasion, ad adjasiment, to engineer public support for an aclivily, Cause, TOwENbeNL, or instibution” (Hemays,
1955, p. 2). Inthe Engineering of Consent, Bernays (2955) lays our che framewark for understanding the public
and developing a public relations compoign. Bernays (1955) claims that the key toa successful public relations
cart is adjustment of the campaign to the attiqudes of various groups in society, gathering information
to effectively express an idea, and finally, utilizing persuasion 16 influence the public opinion in the intended
direction.
