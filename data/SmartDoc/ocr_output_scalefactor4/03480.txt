Uses and 20 A beelhi approach became prevailing in the late 1450s fill 2970s when televigion has grown
Up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were Proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among

the group of scholars whe focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the rest well-knoren
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and as 4 communication researcher. Me received his Ph.D. in Sa
tiology in 1956 from Calumbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 163. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government af israel, Ratz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of televicion broadcasting. This experience Ind to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s tol990s (PENN, 2004). in
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and ako directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Katz's mentor in Colurnbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, who is one of the pioneers of gratfications research,
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theany model. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
notion that people use the media to thelr benefit, Ina study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject
which is known as the uses and gratifications research were explored. They viewed the mats media asa means
by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with athers and found that people bend the media ta
their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973). :

Along with colleague Jay G. Blurnler, Katz published a collection af essays on grahtifications In dea whach
were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication. They toak a rare humanistic approach to looking at media
use. They suggest that media users seek aut a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the uses and
they have alternate choices to satisfy their need, (Blurnler & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that media
served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission for both society

and individuals (Blumer and Katz, 1974).
