ft it well accepted that communication thearies have developed through the realms of psychology and so-
ciglagy aver the past 100 years. With illumed by valuable ideas as well as exploring more untilled fields in these
two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding media. As a sub-traditian af
media effects research, uses and gratitications approach is suggested to be originally stemmed from a func-
tonallst paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional theory
on communication agrees with media's eects towards people. For example, a madel often used in the the-
ory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential
effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information inte the consciousness af the masses” (Watson & Hill 1997, p.
105), Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1940s. After that, a shift
which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses
and gratitications approach,

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people ta be attracted to certain media & almast a5 old as
empirical mass communication research itself (McCuall, 1983). Dating back to the 19405, researchers beta
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio pragrammes, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well
as daily newspaper (Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 144, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1944; etc). In these
studies, researchers discovered a lst of functions served either by same specific content or by the medium
inself (Katz et all, 1974]. For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy thelr listeners with advice,
support, or occasions far emotional release [Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was ake discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure ta the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term "gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s ll 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Amang
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz is served both as @ sociologist and as @ communication researcher He received his Ph.O, in So-
civlogy in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. fn the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force changed
wath the intreduction of television broadcasting. This experience bed to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 130s tola0s (UPENN, 2001), In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study,

Katz's mented in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsheld, who i one of the pioneers of gratifications research.
Their cooperating werk produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratihcations with the
functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
notion that people use the media to their benefit. Ina study by Katz, Gureviteh and Haas (1973), a subject
which is known as the uses and pratilications research were explored. They viewed the mass media a8 a means
by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to
their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973),

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumer, Ratz published a collection of essays on pratifications in 1974 which
were entitled The Uses af Mass Communication, They took a more humanistic approach to looking at media
use. They suggest that media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the user and
they have alternate cheices to satisfy their need. (Blumler & Katz, 1974), They also discovered that media
served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission for both society
and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974).
