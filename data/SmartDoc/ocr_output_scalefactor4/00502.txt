1 Needs and Gratifications

. | Uses and gratificatons approach emphasizes motives and the sell-perceived needs of audience mem-
bers. Blumilerand Katz (1974) conchuded that different people can use the same communication mea-
sage for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify diferent needs for diferent
individuals. There is not only one way that people uses media. Contrarily, there are as marty reasons
for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individuals background, such ag experience, interests, and
education, aMect peaple’s ideas about what they want from media and which media Best meet Their
needs. That is, audience members ae aware of and can state their own motives and gratificatians =
for using different media. Me Quuail, Bluenter, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-pertan |
interactions” to classity four ienpartard media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or :
problems: emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: comnpanaanghig; social utility; [2] Personal
identity: sel reference; reality exploration; value reforces; and (4) Surveillance {fonms of informa-
Gon seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation wad suggested by McGuire (1974), based
ona general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of meds: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passe” initiation, “external” werd
“miternal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of "growth" and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 d@ferent types of motivations which apply to media use [Figure 1}. Fapare 2. A |
