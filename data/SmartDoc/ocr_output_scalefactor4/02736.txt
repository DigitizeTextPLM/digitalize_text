Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by MeGulre {1974}, based
on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective, Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” Initiation, “external” versus
“internal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply te media use [Figure 1). Figure 1. A
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gureviteh and Haas
(1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding;
_ Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings:
Personal integrative needs, including crealbility, stability, stetus;
