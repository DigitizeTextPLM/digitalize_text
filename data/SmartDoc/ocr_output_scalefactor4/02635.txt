I, EARLY INFLUENCES

Therefore uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication.

The following theorists explore how communication can be a vehicle individuals utilize to reduce
uncertainty,

1 Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication.
The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology atthe University of Lowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,
one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a sub-
stantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics, After Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
(Samelson, 2000). Much of Pestinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin's theories, Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging field of in-
terpersonal communication and on the development of URT. Festinger is best known for the theories
of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theary (CDT) attempted te
explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed CDT
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groupe (Festinger, 1982). CDT allows for three
relationships to occur among cognitions: & consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equi-
librium with cach other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with cach
other; and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another
(West & Tumer, 2000). Cognitive [yissonance, like uncertainty, his an element of arousal and dis-
comfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to
feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual
usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to the self. This need for social comparison can
result in conformity pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, 2004). Berger and Calabrese (1975) related su=
cial comparison to URT by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons seek out similar others
who are proximate when they experience a high level of uncertamty regarding the appropriateness of
their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation’ {p. 107). Festinger received ihe Distinguished
Seientist award of the American Psychelogical Association and the: Distinguished Senior Scientist
Award from the Society of Experimental Social Paychology. Festinger’s legacy is significart, and
his theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemparary social science research. Aronson (in
Festinger, 1980) stated, “It was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed Bis ei of
cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, sockal psychology has nat been the same since” (p. 3).

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1938)

eter earned his doctorate ir philosophy from the University af Graz, During Ais time in
ae Tie fer worked with many renowned psyehologists such as Wolfgang Kohler Hs Miers
wt £ vin, Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin as a substantial impact on his lifes “T want
and Kurt Lev vsinulating influence, which has affected much of my thinking and which is
Trok, although it dees not derive directly from bis work” (Heider, 1958, p.
still eka catia maved to the United States to work at Smith College and later the University of
Hees a eee worked for the remainder of bis life (Ash, 2000).
