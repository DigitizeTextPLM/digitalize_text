1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Reseatch conducted under the title of inerpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion,
social influence, amd small group processes. Theories explored the role of leaning, dissonance, bal-
ance, soclal judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology,
Played a considerable cole in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider,
Kelley, and Howland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social ineeraction,
Telattonal development, and relational comercd. This was influenced by che research of such scholars
as Knapp, Mehrabian, Aliman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the decade
feed into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Raloff, and Berger became popular
long with research into behavioral aod comenunicative adagiation by Giles, Burgeo, and Patterson
Benger (2005) states: “these early cheoretical forays helped shape ibe interpersonal comm research
agenda during the past two decades" (p. 416). Today, imerpersanal communication tends to focus
on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as
a function of developing relationships. Hesearch leeo ingerpersonal communication iheary typécally

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since oncenaincy has been idencified a5 an important consmact, necessary 10 the study of comenu-
nication, it would be beneficial to loecww when the concept originated, amd how it has been defined
am] fudied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory, Shanes and Weaver (145) proposed that uncertainty existed ina given sinaation wher there
was a high amount of possible alternatives amd the probability of their event was relatively eqpaal
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
also contributed to the development of WET, Berger and (Calateese 5) adiopied Concepts from the

information theorists as well as Heider (1954) research in atoriburion. Berger and Calabrese (975)
