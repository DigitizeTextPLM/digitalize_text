4 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language transiation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
cullure industry outside af a German context. in the years since there hawe been murnar-
ous orifice of the text, not least since Adamo made sweeping generalizations about “the
commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adame ered im not discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and fated to ecamine the culture industry's acanamic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adomo and Marcuse averestimated the daminant idealogy, be-
feving that “capitalet society languishes in ihe grip of an all-pervadive reificabon (Eagleton.
4991, p. 46). Stil, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliets
among oporssed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the eys-
tem a& a whole” (Eagleton, 1891. 6. 36). Fredric Jameson pointed oul that Adarna’s Kies
of a culture indusing was hishorcally limited, eine ibe somety that deweloped in the 1560s
and 19706 40h ren media went beyond the cultural possitilins available during the 1940s.
While the dea of the culture induatry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial soci-
pies between 1820 and 1970, trying ta use @ today weakens its effectiveness (Hoherdahil,
1895, p. 146-88). Thus, for a some critica, the value of the dea of the cullure industry would
appear to be merely histoncal, if they in fact conceded that it had any value at all

Thus for same crific modemist works would be counteracting lores against the dominam

declogy. At noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, ft may be the case theat the
dominant ideology can co-opt modernist worke for fis own ends. The idea of the culture
industry haa had an importance in critical theory since ts appearance in the 1540s, in that
it has led to fhought about the role of mass communications in relation to ideology, and
hence, society. Since Adomo made sweeping generalizations aboul the impact of the cuttune
industry, and aince he did nol systematically explore Now the Culture industry operabed, ft has
been generally easy for some bo dismiss the dea of a cullure induaby. It 6 nonetheless ihe
