t Eee many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural linguistics.
o aussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation
by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set
of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which compose
it, @S Opposed to it, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language" (Barthes, 1967,
p.13). Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimension. Tha structure level,
langue, is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized.
On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level, However,

it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free fram the
shared convention, the structure,

A, language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of
language, itis essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one
wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that tt
resists the modifications caming from a single individual and is consequently a social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It if because speech 1s

essentially a combinative activity that it cormesponds to and individual act and net to a pure

creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-1 By
