to disseminate propaganda under tle fascist and Stalinist dictwtorships. The essay translated a3 “On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Repraduction™ (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62), A pri-
mary problem for Adomo lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concer hall, symphonic works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records, The result was inferior to the
original, and Adorno was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the mew listening help to inake escape fram ihe whole infantile milieu
impossible" (Ademo, 2001, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by phosograph oc filts
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adora, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamtisi, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge agninet the
authority of Platonic order frat the: topthe original or Idea- ta dewn of layers of imitations; to Adore, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity, The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adomo. In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing @ relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in
New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radia Research Projects rut a el
