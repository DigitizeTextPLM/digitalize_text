1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has heen identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of commu-
nication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined
and studied. Gme way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there
was 4 high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
also contributed to the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the
information theorists as well as Heider (1958) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as
the “number of altermative wavs in which each interactant might behave” (p. 100). The ereater the
level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to pre-
dict behaviors and occurrences. During interactions individuals are not only faced with
predicting present and past behaviors, but alsa ex plaining why partners behave Or
that they do, Berger and Bradac's (1982) definition of uncert ainty highlighted the complexity of this
process when they stated: “Lincertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative thin 5
that a stranger can believe or potentially say” Uncertainty plays a sipnificant role when ear
