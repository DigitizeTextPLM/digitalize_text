Ta Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, ine systematic system an , us ; ee
by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole, Langue is the ee “Hl = he
of conventions necessary fo communication, indifferent to the material of the sign al whit a i =
it; as opposed to it, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of wee ‘seabbel re
p.13). Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimen sion. ag A u - 7
langue, is the social convention of value shared through a society which is sta bilized and standardized.
On the contrary, parole is flexible because tis the actual expression at the individual level, However,
it ig considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the
shared convention, the structure

A language Is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values, It is the social part of
language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entiraty if one
wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it
rasists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is bacause speech Is
essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual act and notte a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is ex pressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the extemal part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actu al animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifie) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts” (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis
(ed), p. 37). The correspondence of the concept'meaning to the external form is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is mot the inevitable internal relaton but the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that "language does
not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from
within itself through a senes of conceptual and phonic differences”. According to Saussure, "meaning
IS Produced through @ process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the Sy ntagmatic
(2.0. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.9.. synonyms), organized into a signifying system" {Barker
2002, p. 23). AS a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the S nta
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possibl ic u —
