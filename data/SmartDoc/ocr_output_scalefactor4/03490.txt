1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry"

The 1872 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
: tent, nied lege since Adoena made ; newalizations aout “
commedified and fetethized character of all culbural goods” (Conk, 1896, pB 113). For ae
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adame erred in net decussing the processes of cul-
tural production, ard failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other

business sectors, including marketing ard advertiging (Goo, 1598, p. 46).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adomo and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology. e-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification’ (Eagleton,
1991. p. 46) Swi, Eagleton conceded that “the difugion of dominant values and borat.
among oppressed peoples in socely has some pan to play in the reproduction af the ty-
jem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adomas dea
of a culture industry was historically limited. since the society that Geweloped in tre 19605
and 1970s with new media wenl beyond the cultural possibilities available during the iGie.
While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for indupinal soci-
plies behween 1920 and 1970), trying to use & today weakens its efeciivencss [Hohendahl,
1995, p. 146-48). Thus, for a some ontics, the value of the idea of the culture industry would
appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any wale a1 all,

Thus for some efities modemist warks would be counteracting fareee against ie dorranaint
ideology. As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case thal the
dominant ideclogy can oo-opt modernist works for iis own ands. The idea of the culture
industry has had an importance in critical theory since itp appearance in the 140s. in that
it has led ta thought about the role of mass communicaions in relation to Keciogy, arr
hence, society. Since Adome made sweeping generalizahand about the impact of the culbure
industry, and since he did not systematically explore how the culture industry operated, thas
been generally easy for some to dismiss the idea of a culture industry, It is nonetheless the
case that motion pictures are stil made by large companies and that their moves lacgely raly
on formulaic plots. It is algo ihe case thai radia is increasingly controlled by a small number
of companies, which tend to impose resinctians on how stations operaie. As a broadcast
medium, televiaion is very much related to bath radio and film, and shares with them quaiities
