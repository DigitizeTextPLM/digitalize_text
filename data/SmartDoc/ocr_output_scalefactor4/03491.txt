1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
henedits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations 18 important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint af others,
to exert leadership in madlifying conditions that affects us, ta evaluate efforts being macde by others,
and ta persuade or suggest courses of action (p. IW}. Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is stall possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion, Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories deseloped by Dippmonn, Dasrwell, Eiiul, and Bernoys are important for o minber of

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the direct effects and limited effects
mexlin models. Theorists such as Ellul tended toa side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
prapaganda could directly influence the thought of the masses, Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippmacin
also noted that the media might oot be influencing only thought, but may aleo be influencing what
people thought about. Tt was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting point for future research
in the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the eek of
Tyengar and Kinder, as well as McCombs and Shaw, Overall, the research of the scholars diene Ar
this paper has been very important to the understanding af the media, the manipulation af the pulsl;
and the formation of public opinion. While the thearies of Lippmann, Lasewell, Bernays ee Ellul
were formed years ago, they continue to help us understand the society that surrounds us today.
