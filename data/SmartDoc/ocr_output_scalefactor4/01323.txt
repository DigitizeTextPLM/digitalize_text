was fascist propaganda (Jager, 200M, p.

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in
Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative
in Europe. The closest thing in Adornos experience to the advertising industry in the United States
122), Adorno was later to allude to his experience with
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorna, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did
not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adornos dissatisfaction with
the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop
the idea of the culture industry.
Because of the relationship between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University,
Horkheimer, who had already moved to California, could not bring Adorno to the West Coast unit
November 1941. When Adorno was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate community that
included Frits Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hane Eisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Ddblin, and
Bertolt Brecht, several of which found work in the Hollywood movie industry. The fact that Adorne
was part of this intellectual community whose members were involved in the production af Hollywecd
movies must have had some influence m developing his thoughts on culture, since the Hollywood system

inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany.

These preconditionsAdornos interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the
relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important to an understanding of

his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adormo, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
eapitaliam, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in

the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl,
1005, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adornowere the Hollywood production system, or
the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit é were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
2002. p. $0). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p.
106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, and Adorno cited Oreon Welles
ah an example of someone whe was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would
allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultirnately rendering it ineffectual
(Friedman, L861, p. 185). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
of social comtral (Horkheimer and Adetno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in & eyebern of economic
eoercion ultimately meant the freedom ta be the same yan and Adora, 202, p. 16).

Culture Industry has been criticized as being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture,
Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art aa the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and
