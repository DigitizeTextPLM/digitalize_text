1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been idencified as am important construct, mecessary io the shady of commua-
gration, 1 would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been degined
and studied One way co consider uncerainry is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed ina given situation when there
was a high amount of potsiibe alternatives and the probabality of their event was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver relaced this view of amcetainty 60 lhe transmission of messages, but their work
alee contributed to the development of UBT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted comcepts from the
information theorists as well as Heider (1950) research in amritution Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncenaaney oo fit interpersonal comevunicateon by defining uncertainty as
the “number of altennative ways in which each inperactant enight behave” (p 100). The greater the
Jevel of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller che chance individuals will be able io pre-
dict behavion: and occurences. During interactions individuals are not only faced with problems of
predicting present and past behaviors, bat also explaining why pariners bebave or believe in the way
that they do, Berger and Gradac’s (1982) definition of umceraincy highlighted the complexiry of this
process when they stated: “Lincertainty, then, can stem from the large number of bliernative things
that @ stinger can beliewe or potentially say" Uncertainty plays a significant mole when examining
relationships. High levels of uncertainey cam severely inhibit relational development, Uncertainty can
