_p. ). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs

among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys-
tem asa whole (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adorno’s idea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the 1960s
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1540s
While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial soci-
eties between 1920 and 1970, trying fo use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl,
1995, p. 146-48). Thus, fora some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry would
appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded thal ithad any value at all.

Thus for some critics modernist works would be counteracting forces against the dominant
ideology. As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case that the
dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of the culture
industry has had an importance in critical theory since its appearance in the 1940s, in that
t has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation to ideology, and
hence, society. Since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about the impact of the culure
industry, and since he did not systematically explore how the culture industry operated, 838
been generally easy for some to dismiss the idea of a culture industry. It Is nonetheless the
case that motion pictures are still made by large companies and that thelr movies largely rely
on formulaic plots. It is also the case that radio is increasingly controlled by a small number
