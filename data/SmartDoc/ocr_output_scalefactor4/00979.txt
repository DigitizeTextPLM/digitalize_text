1. CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing
public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself mare a statement regarding his phrase,
the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more
than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or mise publicity and
propaganda (Bernays, 1985, p.22), Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent a different view of
the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1028, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea
that in attempting to influence the publke, a business nvast study what terms the partnership can be
inade amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, ita aims, ite objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept [p. 66).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Pernays presents public relations as a tool that can be
used to combine the keas of the public and the persuader. The objectiveminded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it [Bernays,
195%, p. 0). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, a8 he recognizes the power of
society, but atill algo claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade of suggest courses af action {p. D0}. Under this framework, wiile manipulation af
the public is stall posaible, it is not im such blatant ignorance mf the public opinian. Theorlets such as
Lippanann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasrwell, Elid, and Bernays are important for @ muember of
reasons. Based on the ideas of hia predeceasars, Lippmann wee oble to bring offention to the fact that
the public is able to be influenced by the media. The werk of Lippmann and hie coflergues has fed bo more
recent research that is mean! fa help wnderstand the influence af the medio on the public, Through the
work Iyengar and Kinder, White, Lewin, and McCombs and Shaw, a tore comprehensive understanding
af the media has heen developed. The public hae now ben made aware carious media functions such os
agendo-setting, gatekeeping, ond priming, and dhe potential effects that these fechreaques cont bane on
their cudiercea,

The thearies presented in this paper have thed heavily to both the direct effects and limited effects
media models. Theorists such as Ellul tended to cide heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
propaganda could directly influence the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippmann
also noted that the media might not be influencing only thought, but may also be influencing what
people thought about. [t was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting point for future research,
in the aren of the limiter! effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work of
Iyengar and Kincer, as well as MeCombs and Shaw, Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in
this paper bas been very important to the woderstanding of the media, the manipulation of the public,
and the formation of public opinion. While the theorle: of Lippmann, Lazswell, Bernays, and Ellul
were formed years ago, they continue to belp ws tiderstaod the society that surrounds us today,
