For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated th :

1991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that ‘the diffusion of dominant Mallee afd Galera
among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the SyS-
tem as a whole" (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adorno’s idea
of a culture industry was, historically limited, sinee the society that developed in the 1960s
and 1970s with new media went bayond the cultural possibilities available during the 1340s,
While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial soci-
éeties between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl,
1995, p. 146-48). Thus, fora some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry would
appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value at all.

Thus for some critics madernist works would be counteracting foreeas against the dominant
ideology, As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case that the
dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of the culture
industry has had an importance in critical theory since its appearance in the 1940s, in that
it has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation to ideology, and
hence, society, Since Adore made sweeping generalizations about the impacto the culture
industry, and since he did not systematically explore how the culture industry operated, it has
been generally easy for some to dismiss the idea of a culture industry. It is nonetheless the
case that motion pictures are still made by large companies and that treir movies largely rely
on formulaic plots. Itis also the case that radio is increasingly controlled by a small number
of companies, which tend to impose restrictions on how stations operate, As a broadcast
medium, television is very much related te both radio and film, and shares with them qualities
that situation It in the culture industry. While there is a democratizing aspect to the Intemet

on the Internat continue to maintain an ideological function. For example, one pes i
new stories on MSNBC or Yahoo that would question the prerogatives of corporat America.
‘a reexamination of the idea of the culture industry may be necessary in order ta tneorze on

how mass communication media propagate dominant ideologies.
