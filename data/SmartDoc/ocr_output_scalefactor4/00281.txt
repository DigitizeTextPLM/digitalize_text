society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible, Bernaye (1952) writes af the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important hecaluse it helpe them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert Jeaderahip in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being maade by others,
and to persuade or suggest courses of action [p. 10}, Under this framework, while manipulation af
the public is stall possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such a5
Lippanann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories dewloped by Lipprnann, Laaewell, Btlul, and Berioye are important for a number of
reasons. Hosed on the ideas of hiv predecessors, Lippmann nos oble fo bring attention to the fact fiat

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily te both the direct eHects and limited effects
media models. Theorists such as Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct effects model, wheretoy
propagands could directly influence the thought of the mases. Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippmann
aso noted that the media might not be influencing only thought, but may alse be influencing what
people thought about. te was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting point for future research
in the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shawn through the work of
Iyengar and Kinder, as well az MoCombs and Shaw, Overall, the research of the scholars peetieees 7
this paper has been very important to the wderstanding of the media, the manipulation of the public
and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasewell, Bernays, and Ellul
were formed years ago, they continge to help us widerstand the aoclety that surcounds i today
