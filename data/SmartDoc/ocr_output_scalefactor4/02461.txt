Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Umeer-
tainty Reduction theory (URT), accredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication, Through the development of URT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information wi i "ep, 153). The study of information is basic
to all fields of communication, 1 certainty in particular advanced theeretical
research in the field of interpersonal coramunication. URT places the role of communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal conumunication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the: interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories as starting points” (p. 99).
