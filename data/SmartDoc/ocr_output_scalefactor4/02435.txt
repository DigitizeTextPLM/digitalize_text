language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one
wishes to communicate. It is because 4 language is a system of contractual values that t
resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social in sti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is bath institution and system, speech 's essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization, The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that It corresponds to and individual act and not to a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The sig nified is a concapt or meaning which is expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are tne extemal forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "| propese to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and te replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that seapa-
rates them from each other and fram the whole of which they are parts” (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis
(ed.), p. 37). The correspondence of the conceptimeaning to the external form is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation but the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that "language does
not reflact a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning fram
within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences” According to Saussure, "meaning
is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic

(é.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (@.g., synonyms}, organized into a signifying system’ (Barker
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
mem bers. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the follow
ing sentence: "| went to a theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence is established through th
linear combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as | theater, my, and girttri me :
substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as "She went to a a t ay cn ce
Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs eae is i anaes
