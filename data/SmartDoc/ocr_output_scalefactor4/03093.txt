1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICA ThONS

1 Needs and Gratifications

asizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience mem-
bers. Blumler and Katz (1974) conc uded that different people can use the sa me ee rice! ped
sage for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for aireren
individuals. There is not anly one way that people uses media. Contra rily, there are as many reasons
for using the media as there are media users [Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual’s background, such
t they want from media anc which media best meet their

education, affect people's ideas about what iii
needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gra au cations
for using different media. McQua |, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a madel of “media-person
interactions” to classify four important media gratifications. (1) Diversion: escape fram routine or
oroblems; emotional release; (2) Personal re ationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal
identity: self reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance (forms of informa-

Uses and gratifications approach em ph

as experience, interests, and

tion seeking}.

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivatio
on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus "nassive” initiation, “external” versus
“internal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “erawth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 19/4 ). Katz, Gurevitch and Haas
(1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and

out them inte five catepories:

was suggested by McGuire (1974), based
f needs: cognitive and

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding;

?. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;

3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, status;

4. Social integrative needs, incluoling interacting with family and friends; and

5, Tension release needs, including escape and diversion,

Congruously, McQuail’s (1983) classification of the following common reasons for media use:

seeking advice on practical matters or opinion and decision choices
satistying curiosity and general interest
learning: self-education

gaining 2 sense of security through knowledge

finding reinforcement for personal values
finding models of behavior
identifying with valued others (in the media)

Baining insight into oneself
