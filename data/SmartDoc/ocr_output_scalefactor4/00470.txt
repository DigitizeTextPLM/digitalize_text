1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Lecvry Festinger studied psychology atthe Univ ersity of lowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,
ial al the Tounders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a sub-
stantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, initially
ND at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
(Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger's research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging field of in-
terpersonal communication and on the development of URT, Festinger is best known for the theartes
of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted to
explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed CDT
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982), CDT allows for three
relationships to occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equl-
librium with each other: a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each
other: and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another
(West & Turner, 2000). Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of arousal and dis
comfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to
feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To ee a laa ee
usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to the self. Thts need for social pis can
result in conformity pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, 2004}. Berger and Calabrese (1 aires pag ee
