Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Uncer-
tainty Reduction theory (URT), accredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J, Calabrese (1975), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning imerpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 133). The study of information is basic
to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
fesearch in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the role of communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
Communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories a5 starting points” (p. 99%,
The research underlying the theon and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of inter-
personal communication research; with the development of URT, communication researchers began to look to
communication for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social

sciences.

1.2. The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Traditionally, communication has been viewed as an interdisciplinary field. Interpersonal communication is
modest amount of research was completed under the label of interpersonal communication. Heath and Bryant
(2000) marked this time as the origin of the field of interpersonal communication: “Particularly simce 1960,
scholars adopted communication as the central term because they wanted ta stualy ifas a significant and unique
aspect of human behavior” (p. $9), The 1960s produced research that impacted the development of an in-
terpersonal field, Research in psychiatry examined personality and the influence of relationships, finding that
psychiatric problems were not only a result of self problems, but a result of relational problems aS well. Re-
search trends in humanistic psychology and existentialism inspired the idea that relationships could be improved
