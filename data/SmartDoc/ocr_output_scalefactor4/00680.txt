conducting beth quantitative and qualitative analyses af propaganda, understancing th e content th propaganda,
and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994), Lasswell is credited with ara
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis og
defined as, "...the investigation of communication messages by categorizing Message content a MiGteLE alton
in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled “Contents of Communication,

Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appeal ina Meshape, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence that runs from control to content and fram content
to audience” (p. 74).

This method of coment analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, “Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" (p. #4), Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the
remainder of his career

‘side from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion, This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
INMETeSted in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still that information thar is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing
ine power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories. a:
