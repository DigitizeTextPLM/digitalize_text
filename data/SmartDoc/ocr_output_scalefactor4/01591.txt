that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least ane obEen is found it
Strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developrienta
of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape
his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a univ ersal pseudo- ult ure
in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film,
Adora conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposttian to
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 191).

9 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to
other writers in the Frankfurt Schoo! (Wigegershaus, 1994, p. 609) Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social contral mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2W0, p 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satished and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83). The

entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were bo
maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.
Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions
(Marcuse, 1991, p. &). However, it ig difficult in Marcuses argument to separane culture
or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass
media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno
had done. In the end Marcuses analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant
ideology. Marcuse Wrote, "how can the administered indivix lualswho have made their mutilation
into their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged scaleliberate
themselves from themselves as well as from their masters ? How is it even thinkable that the
wieious circle be broken?! (Marcuse, 1901, p. 251). Given the pessimistic tone of the book,
‘t is somewhat ironic that lat ely because of it he would be perceived as an icon for leftist
movements of the 1960s in the U.S, and Germany that developed an oppositional stance.
In spite of this, Marcuse maintained that he was a philosopher, and not at activist. Like others
associated with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of the idea that theory could be translated
into practice (Chambers 2004, p. 225)
