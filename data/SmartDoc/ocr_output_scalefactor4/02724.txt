|. GENESIS OF “THE CULTURE INDUSTRY”

1 Genesis of “The Culture Industry”
ure industry as well as its reception the concept can be

examined chronologically, from its pre-conditions, through its generation, to its subsequent impact. The idea af
ihe culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, is developed through insights inte the mechanical re-
| production of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music, but also to Hollywood

| In order to understand the creation of the idea of the cult

movies. That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies.

Adomo was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin
never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno
became in effect Benjamins only pupil. After Benjamin's death “it was Adorno who then introduced a rational-

ized version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (Jager. 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had
an impact on the development of Adornos thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adomo began
| teaching at the Institute, Adorno lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi
party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began
| operating there. The Nazis rise to power not only meant that Adomio lost his job and would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought, As Jiirgen Habermas would later note, the
| fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe-
| riences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production
| of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48).
| Adorne was at Chcford from 1934 to 1938, where he worked on a manuscript on Husserl. He was considered
| an ouisider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frank-
furl School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the late
1930s Adora evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adomo debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Repression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's ibe
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art inthe Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999 : 62). A pri
