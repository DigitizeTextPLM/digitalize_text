1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncerainry has been identified as an important constrict, eecessary to the stody of commu.
nication, ii would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined
and studied One way co consider uncertainty is through ihe theoretical framework of information
theory. Shammon and Weaver (1929) proposed that uncertainty exisned ina given situatban when there
was a high amount of possible alvernarives and che peohabilicy of their event was celatively equal.
Shannen and Weaver related this view of wmcertaincy to ihe transmission of messages, but their work.
also contributed to the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the
information theorists a well as Heider (1958) research im attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the comcepe of ancerainny to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as
the “number of alternative ways in which each inperactant might behave" (p. 100). The greater the
