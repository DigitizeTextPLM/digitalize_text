remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the contentof propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public apinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that 1s presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still hat information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media thar is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories.

1.2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

AL approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bermays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays (1928)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of a
public to an enterprise, idea, of group fp. 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bemays recopnizes
that propaganda can be either benélicial or harmful to the public. Tt can help individuals decide what to think
about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to sociery's functioning a: a whole.
Bemays states, “We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by
men we have never heard of. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live
together a3 a smoothly functioning society {p.

Based on these ideas that the publle opinion can ke modified, and that such shaping is a necessary part of
soclety, Bermays pursued his work in the field of public relations. “Public relations is the attempt, by information,
persuasion, and adjustment, boengineer public support for an activity, cause, movement, or institution" (pee
1955, p. 4). In the Engineering of Consent, Bernays (1955) loys out the framework for understanding the public
and developing a public relations edripiign. Bemays (1955) claims that the key to a successful public relations
campaign is adjustment af the campaign to the attitudes of various groups in society, gathering information
pea express an idea, and finally, ulilizing persuasion to influence the public opinion in the intended
