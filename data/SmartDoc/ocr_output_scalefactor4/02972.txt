OF Using the media as there are media users (Blurnler & Katz, 1974),

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and
education, affect people's Ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their
needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and pratificatians
for using different media, McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person
interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or
problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal
identity: self reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance (forms of informa:
than seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based
on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus
“internal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use [Figure 1}. Figure 1. A.
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (MeGuire, 1974). Katz, Gureviteh and Haas
{1973} developed 35 needs taken from the secial and psychological functions of the mass media and
put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding:
3. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings,

3. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability stots;

4. Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends; and

5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.
