1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culture industry outside of a German context. In the years since there have been numer-
OUS criticisms of the text, nat least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about ‘the
pele Za wa character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
ge ly sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adora erred in not discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and failed to examine the cultura industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, be-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton,
1991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
aMong oppressed peoples in saciety has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys-
tem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adorno’s idea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the 1960s
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1940s.
While the idea of the culture industry can be defended a3 a useful theory for industrial soci-
eties between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl,
1995, p. 146-48), Thus, for a some critics, the value of the dea of the culture industry wauld
appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value al alll, :

Thus fer some critics modemist works would be counteracting forces against the dominant
ideology. As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the cage that the
dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of the culture
industry has had an importance in critical theory since its appearance in the 1940s, in pt
it has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation to aeecuee
hence, society. Since Adomo made sweeping generalizations about the impacto tid A ie
