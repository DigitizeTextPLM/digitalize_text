Heel effects research, uses and gratifications approach is suggested to be originally stemmed from a func-
honalist pa radigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional theory
on communication agrees with media's effects towards people. For example, a model often used in the the-
ory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential
effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information into the consciousness of the masses” (Watson & Hill 1997, p.
105). Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1940s. After that, a shift
which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses
and gratifications approach
The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as
empirical mass communication research itself (McQuail, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such as soap operas and quizzes, a5 well
as daily newspaper (Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1548; etc.). In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium
itself (Katz et al., 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice,
support, or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1943); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratificatians.”
Uses and gratifications approach became orevalling in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when if was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars whe focus on uses and gratifications resear ch, Elihu Katz i one of the most well-known

and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.
Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and a5 a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in 3o-

ciology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught im the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz nea ded the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent ace demic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s to1990s (UPENN, 2001). In
1997, he joined the fa culty of the Annenkerg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its

experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study, ae.
Kate's mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, whois one of the plonders of gratifications researc hi.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that COMMERCE the concept of gratifications with the
functional theary model, Later, Katz ntroduced uses and gratification appres ch cola he ae up with the
