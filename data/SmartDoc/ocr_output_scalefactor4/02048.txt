1 Early Influences

The following theorists Henificanily contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication.
The influence of their work can be sten reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1978),

Li Leon Festinger (1919-1984)

Leon Festinger studied paychology atthe University of lows under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,
ome of the founders of social pevchology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a sab-
alantial influence on the development of interpersonal coenmunication. After graduation, initially
worked ot the University of Rochester, but in 145 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Groep Dvnaniies. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, aed the New School for Soctal Rewearech
{Samelson, 2000), Much of Festinger's research folkrwed his messor Lewin and further developed
Lewin’s theories, Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging field of in«
terpersonal communication and on the development of WRT. Festinger is best known for the theoracs
of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Disaonaece theary (CDT) attemplad &
explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an iedividual, Levin foreshadowed CDT
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982) COT allows for three
relationships W occur among exgeitions: a consonant relationship, which cognitions at in equi-
librium with each other; a dissomant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each
other: and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions im question have no ¢ffeeton one another
(West & Turner, 2000. Cogeitive [kxsonance, like ancertainty, has an element of arousal feud dis-
coenfart that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to
feedback from thers to evaluate their perfeemance pedi abilities, Te evalwate the sel. the individual
wiually secks the opinions of othert who ane sinsilar to the self. This need for socal campurisom can
