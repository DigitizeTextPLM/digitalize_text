Purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different
not only one way that people uses media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons
" as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974),

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and
education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their
needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications
for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person

interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion; escape from routine or

problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal

identity: self reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance [forms of informa-

tion seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGulre (1974), based
ona general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective, Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” Initiation, “external” versus
“internal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use [Figure 1]. Figure 1.4
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch and Haas
(1973) developed 35 needs taken fram the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
put them into five categories:

_ Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding;
Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings:

Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, sterus;

Social integrative needs, including interacting with family ana friends; and
