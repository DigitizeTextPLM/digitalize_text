4 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

the 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the Kies of the
cukure industry outside of a German context In the years since there have been nun”
qua criticiame of the text, not least since Adomo made sweeping generalizations about “the
commodified and telishized characier of all cuRural goods” (Gook, 1996, p. 413), For the
genetally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adamo erred in nat discussing the processes of cul
tural production, and failed to examine the culture indushy's nconomic dependence on ober
business sectors, including marketing ard advertising (Coo p48).

For Tery Eagleton, both Adana and Marcuse cverestinated the daminant ideology, be-
leving thal “capitalist socety languishes in the grip of an al: perverse reification” (Eagheton,
1901, p. 48). Stil, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values are behets.
among oppreteed peoples in socely has some part to play in the reproduction of the y8-
fem as 4 whole” (Eagleton, 1891. p. 36). Fredric Jameson poimbed out that Adomo's idea
cof a culture industry was historically limited, singe the society thal developed in the 1605
and 18706 with new media went beyond the cultural possibile available during the 14065.
While ihe Wea of ihe cumure indusiry can be defended asa useful theory for indusbrial Bor
ees between 1920 and 1970, prying bo wpe it today weakens its efectivencss (Hohendahl,

appear to be merely historical # they in fact conceded that it had ary value ai all.

Thus for some critics modemist works would be eounieracting forces against the dominant
ideology. As noted in the example of Crson Welles, however, it may be the case that the
dominant deslogy can co-opt modernist works for is own ends. The idea of the culture
industry has had an importance in otilical theory ance is appearance in the 1940s, in that
it has led to thought about the role of mass comenunicatiané in relation to ideology, ard

indusiry. and since he did not systematically explore how fhe culture industry operated, it has
been generally eaay for some to dismiss the idea of a cukure industry. is nonetheless the
case thal motion pictures are stil made by large companies and that their movies largely rely
on formulaic plots. [tig also the case thal radio is increasingly controlled by a small number
