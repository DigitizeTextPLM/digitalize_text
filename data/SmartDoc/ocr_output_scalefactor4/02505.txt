it is well accepted that communication thearies have developed through the realms of psychology and so-
ciology aver the past 100 years. With illumed by valuable ideas as well as exploring more untilled fields in these
two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding media, As a sub-tradition of
media effects research, uses and gratifications approach is suggested to be originally stemmed from a furnc-
tionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumer & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional theory
on communication agrees with media’s eects towards people. For example, a madel often used in the the-
ory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that "the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential
effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information inte the cansciousness of the masses" (Watson & Hill 1997, p.
105). Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1940s. After that, a shift
which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses
and gratitications approach.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as
empirical mass communication research itself (MoQuall, 1983). Dating back to the 19405, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio pragrammes, such at soap operas and quizzes, as well
as daily newspaper (Larrefeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc.). In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by same specific content or by the medium
itself (Katz et al, 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy thelr listeners with advice,
suppert, of oceadions for emotional release [Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term "gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s ll 1970s when television has grown
Up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was redidcovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and as @ communication researcher He received his PhO, in So-
civlogy in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. in the late 15650, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force changed
with the intraduction of television broadcasting. This experience bed to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 130s tolSa0s (UPENN, 2001), In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and alse directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study,

Katz's mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsteld, who i one of the pioneers of gratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratihcatons with the
functional theory model, Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
nation that prople use the media to their benefit. Ina study by Katz, Gureviteh and Haas (1973), a subject
which is kriown as the uses and gratilications research were explored. They viewed the mass media as a means
by which individuals conmect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to
their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumer, Katz published a collection of essays on pratiications in 1904 which
were entitled Tha Uses of Mass Communication, They took a more humanistic approach te looking at media
use, They suggest that media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the user and
they have alternate choices to satishy thelr need. [Blumler & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that media
served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmissbon for both poclety
and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974).
