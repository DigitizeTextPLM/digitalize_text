I. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond amything he hacl seen in
Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative
in Europe. The closest thing in Adernos experience to the advertising industry in the United States
was fascist propaganda (Jiger, 2004, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience with
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did
net agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adornos dissatisfaction with
the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop
the idea of the culture industry.

Because of the relationship between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University,
Horkheimer, who had already mowed to California, could not bring Adorno to the West Coast until
November 220. When Aderna was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate communty Hat
included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hang Bisler, Thomes ond Heinrich Mann, Alfred Dablin, and
Bertolt Brecht, several of which found work in the Holljwond mowe industry. The fact that Adorno
wes part of this intellectual community whose members were invelved in the production of Hollywood
thowes niuet have had some influence in developing his thonghis on culture, since fhe Hollywood system
inhibited the creative freedom thot many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany.

These preconditions Adornos interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project. as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the
relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important to an understanding of
his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead
a business, and this in tum became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitaliam, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar ag these tendencies were baged on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl,
1995, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adornowere the Hollywood production system, or
the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula eupplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
2002, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p.
106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles
ag an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the syatem would
allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual
(Friedman, 1981, p. 165), Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
of social control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of economic
coercion ultimately meant the freedom to be the same (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 136).

Since Adorno had been, in his essays on music and radio, an apparent defender of high art. The
Culture Industry has been eriticized as being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture.
Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and
Adorno, 2002, p. LOL). It was not high art that Adorno was presenting as an alternative to the culture
industry, but modernism. Although he provides the idea of an opposing force to the culture industry.
Adorno provides no overt Marxist analysis. Instead, he notes in passing that the dominant system
utilized capacities for mass consumption for entertainment or amusement,

Since Adorno had been, in his essays on music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, The
Culture Industry has been criticized as being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture.
Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and
Adorno, 2002, p. 101).
