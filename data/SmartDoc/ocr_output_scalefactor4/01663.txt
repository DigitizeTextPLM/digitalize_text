19305 Adomo evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adorno debated! mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist i Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated a3 “On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adomo lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adorno was emphatic in his condemnation af the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adome, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film

as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adorno, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea- to down of layers of imitations, to A dorno tras
sroduction was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt sae
was that of Aderno. In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue workine 1
