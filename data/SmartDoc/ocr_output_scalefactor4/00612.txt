Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal comm research

agenda during the past two decades” (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus
on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as
a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theary typically
focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized
that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).

Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has

contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives ta focus

on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in commu nication. Their work

is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our

understanding of interpersonal processes.
