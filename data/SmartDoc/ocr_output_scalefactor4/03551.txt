I, OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1 Other Propaganda Theorists
1.1 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

Ee rt ve writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In
: Dt te propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself
(Rogers, 1994).

Harald Lasswell (1902-1978) was 4 prominent scholar in te area of propaganda research. He focused on
conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the conbent of propazanda,
and discovering the «(fect of j bare or

ci propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasawell is credited with creating
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis can be
defined as, "the investiparion of communication messages by categorizing message content into classifications
in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled “Contents of Communication,"
Laséwell (1946) explains that a content analysis shauld take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear ina message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that nuns fram control to content and freen coment
to audience” [p. 74).

This method of content analysis is ted strongly to Lasswell (1993) early definition of communication which
stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects” (p. 44). Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went an to doa lot of work within this area during the
remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was alse interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system, In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and alse apprehensive te accepe it. However, itis still that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media thar is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories.

1.2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Laswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bemays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bermays (1528)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relatians of a
public 12 an enterprise, idea, or group {p- 25). Contrary to ather propaganda theorists, Bermays recognies
that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public. [t can help individuals decide whas to think.
ghout or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial ta society's functioning as a whole.
Bemays states, “We are governed, our minds ane malded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by
men we have never heard of,.. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperabe in this manner Lf they are te live
together as asmacthly functhoning sockery (p- 2). ues

Based an these ideas that the public opinion can be modified, and chat such shaping & 4 ecessary part af
gociety, Berays pursued bis work inthe field of public relations. “Public relations Is Kye attempt, pe
persuasion, and adjustment, ta engineer public suppart for an activity, cause, movement, ar institution” (Bemays,
1955, p. 3). Indhe Engineering of Consent, Bernays (2955) lays our the framework for Pembina 2b the public
and developing a public relations campaign. Bernays (1955) claims that the key to a successful public relatives
campaign is adjustment af the campaign to the attitudes of varkous praups in society, gathering information

direction.
