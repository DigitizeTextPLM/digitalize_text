A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. it is the social part of
language, tis essentially a collective contract which ane must accept in its entiraty if one
wishes lo communicate. It is because a language is a sysiem of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social insil-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. lt is because speech is

essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual act and notte a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1967, op. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the
signified and the signifier, The signified is a concept or meaning which i6 expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating tne opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959, inR Innis
(ed.), p. 37). The correspondence af the conceptimeaning fo the external form is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation, It is not the inevitable internal relation bat the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying system Saussure (1960) argues that “language aie
