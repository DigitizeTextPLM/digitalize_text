wat part of this intellectual community whose members were invalved in the production of Hollyueed
movies must have had some influence in developing his thoughts on culture, since the Hollywood system
inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany.

These preconditionsAdornes interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in Califorma and the
relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important to an understanding of
tus concern for the idea of the culture industry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adore, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itselfas art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
{Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl,
1995, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adornowere the Hollywood production system, or
the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
2002, p. 4), Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the aystem,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adomo, 2002, p.
106-7}. Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles
as an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would
allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual
(Friedtnan, 1981, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
of social contrel (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of economic
coercion ultimately meant the freedom to he the same (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 136)
