1940s the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises

in 1951. Horkheirner
became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954 Adorno published an essay
entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of a study that had been done for the
Hacker Foundation, with the invalvernent of George Gerbner and others, In this essay Aclorno
warned, rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed
of psychological control (Adorno, 2001a, p. 160). It was one of the few occasions in the 1954s
that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments
of the fifties { Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape
his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture
in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered, In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film,
Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition toa

the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 131}

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society ito a systematic context, as opposed to
other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society [Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose maint objectives WETE 5G
maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that miaintal ned that control

Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions
(Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, it is difficult in Mar uses argument to separate culture
aa mass media from society a5 a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or a
media as entities separate from the totality of dormunant ideology in the same way that Adorno

had done. In the end Marcuses analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the correct
