tion to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily

manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which

can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea

that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be

made amicable and mutually beneficial. [t must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 66)

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Rel (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
marmipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays,
Loz, p. 8). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to ewert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade or sugpest courses of actlon (p. 10). Under this tramework while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as

Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.
