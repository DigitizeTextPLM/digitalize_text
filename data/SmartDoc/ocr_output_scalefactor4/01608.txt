__ According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu
nicated through certain channels over time among the ae pt social system. An Innovation
13 nt idea, Practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adaption, The diffu-
S00 of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 4095,
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Laswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, $-M-C-R-E
(¢.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this S-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model cormesponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be invertors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3} channels can be
Interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(3) the effects can be individual’s adoption or social change, In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variable
is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innowvation-decision process; (2) inmovativencss; (3} an innovation's rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption, Ojfision research hes attempted to explain the variables

There are five different types of adopters in the ciffusion process, according to Inmovativeness:
*(1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (3) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185), Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively corlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure | shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by inniovativencss and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories
follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped. Source by www2.gsu.eduw werwite docs /dif-
fusion! Figure 2 shows that an innovation would spread through society over various periods of time in
a S-shaped curve, However, as noted above, different types of innwvations (e-g,, the rate of tetracycline
adoption is faster than that of the hybrid seed com) can have their own different rates in diffusion, Fig-

cept/02.html When it comes to the process of innovation-decisions, Rogers (1993) mentioned that
there are five stages.

i. Knowledge + or — (selective exposure of awareness of news)

9. Attitudes + or — (people have positive or negative attitude toward innovations)

3, Adoption (Decision): people decide to adopt the innovation

4, Implementation (regular or standard practice)
