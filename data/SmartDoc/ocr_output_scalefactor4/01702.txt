Li Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harald Laswell was und P

(Ropers, 1954), ;
Harold Lasswell (1021978) was a prominent scholar it the area of propaganda bic! - x ey

and discovering the effect of propaganda ar Ue mass andience (Ragers, 1994). Lasswell is credine ae site
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1954). Generally, combent an peockinene 3
defined as, "...the investigation of communication messages by categorizing messape content inbe a fab
in oeder to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1954). In an estay entitled “Contents ef Commu cation,
Lasswell (2946) explains chat a content analysis ghauld take into account the frequency with which certain
eymbols appear in a mestage, the directian in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, ane

the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to
rom control to content and from content

raking empirical analyses of propagarela. In

This method of content analysis is tied strangly to
slated, "Who says what in which chanoel to wham ard w

Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which

otof work within this area during the

remainder of bis career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasewell has created a cycle, whereby the public ts limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government, This is an interesting way of vlewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’ thearkes.

1.2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

AL approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1991-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion, Bernays (1928)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape evence to influence the relations of a
public to an enterpeise, idea, or group (p. 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bemays recognizes
that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public. [t can help individuals decide what to think
about ar alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to society's functioning a5 a whole.
Hemays states, “We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by
men we have never heard of... Vast oumbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live
together a5 a smoothly functioning sockety (p. 9).

Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be modified, and thar such sh i cessary
society, Bermays pursued his work in the field of public relations, “Public relations is ee ae
persuasion, and adjustment, to engineer public support for an activin, cause, movement, orinstininn™ (Berna a
