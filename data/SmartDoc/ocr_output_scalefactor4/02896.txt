propaganda (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent a different view of
he formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily
Mmampulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which

can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea

that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be

made amicable and mutually beneficial. Tt must explain itself, its airs, its objectives, to the

public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept [p. G6).
Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting bo

manipulate the puble through propaganda, Be vs presents public relations as a tool that can be

used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader, The objective-minded public relations

man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust te it [Bernays,

1952. p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,

ta exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate ettorts being made by others,
and to persuade or suggest courses of action (p. 10).
the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as

Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.
