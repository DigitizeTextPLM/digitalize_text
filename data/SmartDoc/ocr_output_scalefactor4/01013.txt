gn s€5. The la Content may gratify different needs for different
individuals. There is not only one way that people uses media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons
for li the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situati on, and the individual's background, evich as experience, interests. and
education, affect people's ideas about what they want from média and which media best reat Pian
needs. That is, audience members are awa re of and can state their own motives and gratifications
for using different media. McCuail, Blumer, and Brown (19 72) proposed a model of “media-person
interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or
problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal
identity: self reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance (forms af informa-
tion seeking),

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was Suggested by McGuire (1974), based
on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus
“internal” goal orientation, and emotion stabi ity of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch and Haas
(1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding:

2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;

3. Personal integratve needs, including creaibility, stability, status;

4. Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends; and

5, Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Congruously, McQuail’s (1983) classification of the following common reasons for media use:

« finding out about relevant events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society and the

world

« seeking advice on practical matters or opinion and decision choices
« satisfying curiosity and general interest
* learning; self-education

* gaining a sense of security through knowledge

« finding reinforcement for pe rsonal values

« finding models of behavior
