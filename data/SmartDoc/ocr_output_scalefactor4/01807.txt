1. CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing
public opinion [Bernays, 1955, p22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase,
the engineering of consent, He said, Engineering implies plannitg. And it is careful planning more
than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or mise publicity and
propaganda (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Furthermore, Bernays theeries also represent a different view of
the formation of public opinion, In opposition to Lippmann, whe views the public as being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea
that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can. be
made amicable and mutually beneficial. Tt must explain itself, its aim, its objectives, to the

public in terms whith the public can understand and is willing to accept [p. 66).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting te
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presenta public relations as a teal that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The abjectiveminded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bermays,
1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recagnizes the power af
society, but still aleo claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) write: of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helpe them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, bo know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being mide by others,

and to persuade or suggest courses of actlon (p, 10}. Under this framework, while manipulation bf
the public is still possible, it ls not in such blatant lgnorance of the public opinion. Theorists euch as
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories demeloped by Lippmann, Desrwell, Elia, and Bernays are tnportont for a memier of
reasons. Based on the ideas of his predeceasors, Lippmann wos able to bring offention to the fect that
the public iy able da de inflrenced by the media. The work of Lippman and Ais colleagues Ags fed fo more
recent research that ig meont to help understand the influence of the media on the public. Through fhe
work Iyengar and Kinder, White, Lewin, and AieCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensive nnderstanding
af the media haz wen developed. The public has tow seen made aaare eartoue media functions such os
agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming, and the potential effects that these technipues con hace or
their audiences.

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the direct effects and limited effects
media models. Theorists euch a2 Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct efects model, whereby
propaganda could directly influence the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, theoriata such ae Lippeann
alien noted that the media might not be influencing only thought, but may sleo be Influencing what
people thought about. [t was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting point for future research
in the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work of
this paper bas been very important to the understanding of the media, the manipulation of the public,
and the formation of public opinion. While the theories: of Lippmann, Laswell, Bernays, and Ellul
were formed years ago, they continue ta belp os understand the society that surrounds us today.
