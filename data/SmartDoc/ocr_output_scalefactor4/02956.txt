In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gorevitch also commented that, althoigh peeviou: reearches on
gratification devected diverse gratifications that attract people an the media, they did not addiness the
eqmmnections berween these gratificaions (Rate et al., 1974a). They suggested that uses and gratafi-
