comenodiiied ate swreping generalzations about “the
and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996, p 114). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adome erred in nat discussing the processes of cul
tural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on offer
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1963, p. 48).
_ Far Terry Eagleton, both Adorne and Marcuse overeshmated ihe dominant ideciogy. be
linving that “capitalet society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasne reificatian” (Eagleton,
1901, p. 46). Stil, Eagleton conceded that “the défusion of dominant values and beliets
among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the py5-
tem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991. p. 38). Fredric Jameson pointed aut that Adonno’s idea
of a culture industry was historically limited. singe the society thal developed in te 1960s
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 10s.
