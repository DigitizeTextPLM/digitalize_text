Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure ale reel eo
To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system an

A language is therefore, -@ social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of
language, itis essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one
wishes ta communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is bath institution and system, speach is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization, The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual act and not to @ pure
creation. (Barthes, 1997, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the ward
dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "| propose to retain the word sign (signe) ta
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifier (significant); the last twa terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts” (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis
(ed.), p. 37). The correspondence of the conceptmeaning to the external farm is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation but the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that “language does
not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from

within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences". According to Saussure, "meaning

is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic

(e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (¢.9.. synonyms), organized into a signifying system” (Barker,
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
mem bers. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider th

ing sentence: "| went to a theater with " Thi ir" games hipiliate

linear combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as | theate j a
