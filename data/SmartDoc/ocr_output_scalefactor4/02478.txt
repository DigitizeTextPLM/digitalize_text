They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media and audiences:

definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience
member.

2. In the mass communication process much initiative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on
theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and

behavior.
3, The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
mass communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs,
and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consump-

tion certainly varies.

4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- Le., people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in
particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

5, Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should
suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms. (p. 15-17).
