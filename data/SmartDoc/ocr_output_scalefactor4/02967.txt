p.13). Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure :

On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expressior tt
it is considered relatively flexible due te the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the

shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of
language, itis essentially a collective contract which one mu st accept in its entirety if one
wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the madifications coming fram a single individ ual and is consequently a social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds ta and individual act and not to a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system inte two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.
The form ig called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word

P a
dog in English or in Korean are the exter al forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "l propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to reolace concept and saund-image respectively by signified (signifia) and
signifier (significant); the last twa terms have the advantage of indicating the apposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and fram the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis
{ed.). p. 37). The correspondence of the conceptimeaning to the external form is nat in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation but the difference
between the signs that operates the siq nifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that “language does
not reflact a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from
within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences”, According to Saussure, “meaning
is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic
fe.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic {2.g., Synonyms), organized into a signifying system’ (Barker,
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
sameé paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic communi
members. Foran example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the f ate
ing sentence: “I went ta a theater with my girlfriend." This sentence i aaa
linear combination of si i ith ‘ oe eee araugh the
nation of signs. The signs within the example, such as | theat inlfri
substituted for by other signs i iamati eaten My, ad girirlend can be
or by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as "Sh i
