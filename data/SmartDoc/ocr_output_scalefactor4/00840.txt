1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important ennstruct, necessary C0 the study of commu-
nication, it would be beneficial ta know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined
and studied. One way 16 consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory, Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there

was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal.
