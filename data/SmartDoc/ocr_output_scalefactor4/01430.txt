the culture industry grows out of a concem with culture, 1s developed through insights inte the m ‘ i -

movies. That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies. : : Paes

became in effect Benjamins only pupil, After Benjamin’s death “it was Adomo who then introduced a rational
ized version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (Jager, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had
an impact on the development of Adornos thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adomo began
teaching at the Institute, Adomo lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power we en
pany. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began
operating there, The Nazis rise to power not only meant that Adomo lost his job and would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jiirgen Habermas would later note, the
fact that labor movernents were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe-
riences influencing the development of critical theary, the others being Stalinist repression and the production
of mass culture in the United States (Morns, 2001, p. 48).

Adorno was at Oxford from 1934 t 1938, where he worked on a manuscript on Husserl. He was considered
an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frank-
furt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the late

19306 Adorno evidenced little hope for mass culture, As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adomo debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascial and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin’s more
oplimistic essay, “The Work of Artin the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adomoe lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could
new be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adome was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adomo, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adomo, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authemicity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea- to dewn of layers of imitations: to Adora, mass
preluction was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity, The general attitude of the Frankfurt aioe
