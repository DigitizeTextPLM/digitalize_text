1.100 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger steadied psychology at the University of lvwa under the direction ot Kant Lewin. Lewin,
one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research od group dynamics. bad a eab-
#antial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. Aber graduation, imitially
worked at the University of Rochester, but im 1944 he followed Lewin to Misssachmsetts Tnsti-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked ar the Univensty of Michigan, Stanford! University, and the Mew School for Socal Research
(Samelson, 2000). Much of Pestinger's research followed bis mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin’: theories. Several of Festinger theorses were highly influential on the emerging Geld of im-
terpersonal communication and on the develogenent of WRT. Festinger is for the theories
of Cogeilive Dassonance and Social © amon. Cognilive Dissonance then T) atiempted to
explain how an imbalarce among cog might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed COT
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 982). CDT allerws for three
relationships to occur among cognitions: @ condemn! relationshap, in whick cognitions ane in equi-
Gbrium with each ether, a dissoneet relationship. in which cognitions are im competition with each
other) and an ielevant relationship, in which the cognitions in. question have ne effect on ane another
(West & Turner, 2000). Cognitine Dissonaece, like uncertainty, has an element of arousal and dis
comfort thal individ seck to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to
feedback from eahers to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the inedividisal
usually seeks che opinioes of others who are Senilar to the self, This eed for socked comparison com
result in conformity pressancs (Tirenholen & Jemsen, 24), Berger and Calabrese (1975) related so-
cial comparison to LRT by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons seek owt similar others
who are prosimale when they experience a hagh level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of
their bebhaydor andar options ino particular situation” (p. 107). Festinger moaciwed the Distinguished
Scientist award of the Aumerican Psychological Assocation and the DMatinguished Senior Scientist

his theoretical influence con still be recognized in contemporary sestal scence research, Aronson (in
Festinger, (980) stated, “li was in this era thal Leon Festieger miventad and developed haa theory of
cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, socal paychology has not been te sane since” (p. 3).
