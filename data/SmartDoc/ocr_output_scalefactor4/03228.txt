1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother te preient itself as art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 15). This business was based an what Adore referred to as Fordist
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques use by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and lerarchy (Hohendahl,
1095, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adormmowere the Hollywood production system, or
the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project, Movies
and hit sIngE were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
2002, p. $41). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 202, p.
106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reafirm the system, andl Acorn cited Green Welles

allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ulthmately rendering it ineffectual
(Friedman, 1981, p, 1f16). Like religion and other institutions, the culture induatry was an instrument
