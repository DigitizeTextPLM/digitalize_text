Ll Harold Lasswell (15902-1578)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasewell was undertaking empincal analyses of propaganda. In
fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining, was actually being written by Lippmann himself
(Rogers, 1994).

Harokd Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area ol propaganda research. He focused on
conducting both quantiative and qoalilative analyses ol propaganda, auderstanding the content of propaganda,
and discawering the elect ed propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1944). Lasswell is credited with creating
the mass. Communication procedure of comem analysis (Rogers, [4). Generally, content anatysis can be
defined as, °_the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message contac ino classificarions
in onder lo measure certain wariahhes" (Rogers, 15944). In an essay encitked “Coments of Commenication,*
Lasswell (1946) caplains that a coment analysis stould cake ino accoumt the freqeency wilh which certaie
symbols appear in a message. the direction im which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the intensity of the eymbok gus. By understanding che coment of dhe Mesipe, Lasswell (1946) aim to
achieve the goal of undersanding the “stream of influence that runs from conmed oo comment and from conient

This meted of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasewell (0953) early definition of commenication which

gated, “Who says whar in which channel wo whoo and with what effects” (p. 84). Coment analysis was essen

Aside from understanding the coment of propaganda, Lakwwell was alto inperesned in how propaganda could
