Propaganda (Bernays, 1966, p22). Furthermore, Bernays theorles alsa represent a different view of
Ls formation of publi: opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, whe views the public az being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which
ed be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. €6). Instead, Ternays (1928) offers the ides
that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be
inade amicable and mutually beneficial, Tt must explain itself, ite aims, its objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 66).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Arlations (1962), Hather than merely attempting ta
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tocl that can be
aged to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader, The objective-minded public relations
mat helps his clent adjust to the contemporary situation, ar helps the public adjust to it (Bernays,
1852, p. 9). Bernays view of the public ia aolter than that of Lippmann, a5 he recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Gernays (1952) writes of the
benefite of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because: it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to excert leadership in modifving conditions that affects ws, te evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade of sugeest courses of action [p. 10). Under this famework, while manipulatian of
the public is still possible, tt is mot in auch blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists each as
Lippmane and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

The theories presented in this paper have ted heavily to both the direct effects and limited effects
media models, Theorists such as Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
propaganda could directly influence the thought of the masses, Meanwluile, theorists such as Lippmann
also noted that the media might net be influencing omly thought, but may also be influencing what
people thought about. It was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting point for future research
in the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through. the wack of
Tyengar and Kinder, as well as McCombs and Shaw. Overall, the research of the scholars chscusaed in
this paper has been very important to the understanding of the media, the manipulation of the public,
and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul
were formed years ago, they continue to help us understand the soclety that surrounds us today.
