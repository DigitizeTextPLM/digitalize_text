1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach emphases matives and the self-perceived needs af audience mem-

bers. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication me
sage for very different purposes, The saree media content may gratify different needs for diferent
individuals. There is not only one way that people uses media, Cantrarily, there are as many neasans
for using the media as there are media users [Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experionce, interests, and
education, afect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their
needs, That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and pratifications
for using different media. icQuall, Rhumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-persan
interactions” to classify four important media grattications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine of i

problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships compardanshig; socal utilty: (3) Personal }
identity: self relerence; reality exploration, wale reinforces; and (4) Surveillance [fanms af informa-
