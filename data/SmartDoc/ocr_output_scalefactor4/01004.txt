According to Pagers (135), diffusion refers to “the process by which an inncwation is corals

interpersonal or mass communication, (4) recelvers can be members of a social system, and fireally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social chacype. In the diffusion theory, “Time” variable

There are five different types of adopters im the diffusion process, according lo [nnovalivercss:
“(1 Innovators (venturezome), (7) Early Adequers (respectable), (3) Early Mlaparity (Deliberabe i, (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (3) Laggards (traditional) (Rogers, | 905, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined
ghia term as “ihe degree to which an individual is relatively earler in adopting new ideas Chas other
members offhis sicial systems” (Rogers, (95, p. 40). Figure 0 shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innowaliwences and their place on the adoption curve, Also, these calegories
