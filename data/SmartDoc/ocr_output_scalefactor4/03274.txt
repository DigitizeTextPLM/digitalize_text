1 Early Influences

The hollow ing theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication,
The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of lowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,
one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a sub-
stantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
(Samelson, 200). Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin’s theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging field of in-
terpersonal communication and on the development of URT. Festinger is best
af Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted to
explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed CDT
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). CDT allows for three
relationships to occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equi-
librium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each
ather: and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another
(West & Turner, 2000). Cognitive Nissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of arousal and dis-
comfort that individuals seek to reduce Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to
feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual
usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to the self, This need for social companson can
result in conformity pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, 2004). Berger and Calabrese (1975) related so-
cial comparison toe URI by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons seek out similar others
who are proximate when they &x perience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of
their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation” (p. 107). Festinger received the Distinguished
Scientist award of the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Senior Scientist
Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger’s legacy is significant, and
his theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research. Aronson (in
Festinger, 1980) stated, “It was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed he theary of
« dissonance, and in my opinion. social psychology has not been the same since’ {p. 3).
