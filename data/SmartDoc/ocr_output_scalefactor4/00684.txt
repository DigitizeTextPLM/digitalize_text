1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-tweetieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the develogment of communication theory. Information exchange & a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Cancer
minty Reduction theory (LRT), accredited ta Charles R, Bergerand Richard J, Calabrese (1973), recognized that
reducing uncertainty wes a central motive of communication, Through the development of URT, these scholars
pioneered the fleld of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communicatron
is the acquisition of Information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 153). The study of information i basic:
to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the role of communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
Shrese (19°75) notes “When communicalion researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication prosess, they have tended to employ social psychological theories a5 starting points” (p. 94).
The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of inter-
personal communication research, with the development of URT, communication researchers began to lok to
communication for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social
Echences.

12 The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

scholars adopted communication as the central term because they wanted ta study if ay @ sierdficam ane tunis im
aspect of human behavior" {p. 39). The 1960s produced research that impacted the development of ae
terpersonal field. Research in paychiatry examined personality and the influence of relationships, finding that
psychiatric problems were not only a result of self probleme, but a result of relational problems as well, Re-
