Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural linguistics.
To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system a
by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized
of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent te ihe material of the signal which compose
it as opposed to ll, speech (parole) ic covers the purely individual part of language” (Barthes, 1987,
p.13}. Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level,
langue, is the social convention orvalue shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized.
On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is tne actual expression at the individual level. However,
it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the

shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore, -a social instrution and a system of values. Itis the social part of
language, itis essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one
wighes to communicate. itis because a language fs a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming from a single individual ared is consequently a social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view fo expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that It comesponds ta and individusal act and not to @ pure
creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Fecusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. Far example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the extemal forms expressing the actual animal deg. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "| propose to retain the word sign (signe) ta
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they ane paris” (Saussure, 1959, in FR. Innis
(ed.), p. 37), The correspondence of the conceptimeaning to the extemal form &s not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation, itis mot the inevitable Internal relation but thee difference
beabween the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that language dose
nat reflect a pre-exishent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning frarn
within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences". According to Saussure, “meanin

is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs alang bad axes, the eeaea nate
(9. a Sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g., synonyms}, organized into a signifying system" (Barker
2002. p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible mane that ca
ber replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within a
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic comm
members, For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the ee
