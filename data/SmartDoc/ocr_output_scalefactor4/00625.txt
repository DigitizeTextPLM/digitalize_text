1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic scumplions were stated ina study of Katz, Blomier, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows.
They provide a framework for understanding the correlation berween media and audiences:

. The audience is concenved a5 active, i.2,, am important pact of of mass media use is
assumed 10 be goal oriented ... patterns of media use are shaped by mone or less

definite expectations of what certain kieds of coment have io offer the audience
reemniber.

2. othe mass communication process much initiative in linking need gratification and
Média choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limiracion on

theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media coment an antinodes and
behavior.

. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
Tass COnUnicalion constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs,
and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consump:
Gon certainly varies.

. Methodedlogically speaking, many of the goals of mass nvedia use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- ie. peaple
are sufficienily self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in

particular cases, of at lease te recognize them when confronted with them im an
intelligtble amd familiar verbal formulation.

& Walue judgments about the cultural sagnificance of mass communication should be
suspended while aechence orentalions are explored om Cher own terns, (p. 15-17)

In addition, Kate, Blumler, amd Gurevitch also commented chat. although previews psearches on
peatificacions detecced diverse gratificatbors that aimract people on the media, they did not address che
connections between these gratifications (Katz ef al, 197a), They suggested that uses and gratifi-
carbons research concer with following aspects: “(1) the social and che paychological origins of (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass eredia of other sources which lead te (5) dil-
ferential exposure (or engaging in other activities). revolting in (6) need gratification and (7) other
Comaquences, perhaps mostly unincended omes* (Kacz et al. 14%ab, p. 20) The studies of Katz and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of buikding che wees and gratifications approach. Since
