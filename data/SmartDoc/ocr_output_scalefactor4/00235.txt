I, OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1 Other Propaganda Theorists
L1 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

rat i hao propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In
fa af the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself
(Rogers, 19594).
Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on
i i ee i and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda,
rering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswell is credited with creating
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis can be
defined as, *...the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classitications
in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled “Gontents of Communication,”
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasawell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that puns from centred to content ane from content
to audience” (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is thed strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, “Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" (p. 64), Gaotent analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went an ta doa Int af work within this area during the
remainder of his career,

Aside from understanding the coment of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in bow propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects ofthe media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within 4 democratic system. In this
way, Laswell has created a cycle, whereby the puwhlic is limited in the information that ls presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it. However, {tis still that information that is affecting their decisians within
the democratic system, and is being, presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories.

1.2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

AL approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, ated public opinion. Bernays (1924)
defines propaganda as, 4 consistent, enduring effort ba create or shape events ba influence the relations af a
public to an enterprise, idea, ar group (p. 25). Contrary ta other propaganda theorests, Bemays recognizes
that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public. It can help individuals decide what to think
about ar alter the opinions of individuals, but ehis may actually be beneficial ta society's functioning asa whole.
Bermays states, “We ane governed, air minds are molded, our tastes formed, our {dew suggested, largely by
men we bave never heard of... Vast pumbers of buran beings must cooperate in this manmer if they are to live
ass smoothly functioning society (p- 9). ;

Based on these ideas that the public opinion cam be modified, and that such shaping is a necessary part nf
society, Bemays prursued is work in the field of public reLsdions. *Pyhlic relasions is the attempt, by information,
persuasion, and adjusiment, ta engineer public supparl foram activity, cause, movement, ar institution (Bemays,
1955, p. 2). nthe Engineering of Carsent, Bernays (1955) bays que the framework for understanding the public
ne developing a public relating campaign. Bermays (1955) claims that the key bo a successful public relations
campaign is adjustment of che campaign to the Aitinades af warkous groups im sockety, gathering innformatiars
to effectively express an Idea, and finally, utilizing persuasion ta influence she public opinion in the intended
direction.
