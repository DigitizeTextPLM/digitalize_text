operating there. The Nazis rise to power not only meant that Adorno bast his job and would eventually fore a his
oe PArmure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thoumht. As Jiitgen Habermas would later note, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe-
nences influecting the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48).

furt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the late
1930s Adomea evidenced litth hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
19305, Benjamin and Adomo debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships, The essay translated as “On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brumkhorst, 1999, p, 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adomo lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard over the radia, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adorno was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the mew listening help to make escape from tp er aon ar
impossible” (Adorno, 20016, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of seme ploortenge *P se 2 -
