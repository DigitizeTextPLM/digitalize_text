I. GENESIS OF “THE CULTURE INDUSTRY”

1 Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry as well as its reception the concept can be
examined chronologically, from its pre-condition, through its generation, to its subsequent impact. The idea of
the culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, is developed through insights into the mechanical re-
production of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music, but also to Hollywood
movies. That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies.

Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin
never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno
became in effect Benjamins only pupil. After Benjamin's death “it was Adormo who then introduced a rational-
ized version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (Jager, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had
an impact on the development of Adomoes thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adomo began
teaching at the Institute. Adorno lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi
party, Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began
operating there, The Nazis rise to power not only meant that Adorno lost his job and would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As J0rgen Habennas would later note, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe-
riences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production

of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48).

Adorno was at Oxford from 1934 to 1938, where he worked ona manuscript on Husserl, He was considered
an utsider, never integrating inte the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frank-
furt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the late
1930s Adore evidenced little hope for mass culture, As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adomo debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Artin the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adomo lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could

now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adomo was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the mew listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adamo, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adorno, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity, To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
awihority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea- to down of layers of imitations; to Adamo, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity, The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
wes that of Adorno. In 1935 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in
New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, run by Paul Lazars-
feld. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although he later claimed that he did not know what a “radio project” was. For his part,
Lavarsfeld looked forvard to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be an expert on music. Adome
wrate for the Project’s journal in 1941, reiterating his position that radio was only an image of a live perfor-
mance. In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio industry that the medium was bringing serious music
to the masses (Wiggershaus, 1944, p. 243). While working at the Princeton Radio Research Project Adorno
became shocked at the degree to which culture had become commercialized in the United States,
