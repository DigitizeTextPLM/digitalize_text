Like many other structuraliat scholars, Barthes wae infuenced by Saussure structural inguistics,

A language is therefore, “a socal inaifuten and a system of values lt is the social part of

Focusing on the syetematic lewél, Sausurre aiatinguahes te language sybter Inbs two parte, Fee

The form is Galied the signifier, which is the axternal part of language. For soample, Goth the word

Through the syniagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us thal signs are operabed only wher
they ane related to each other “Crucially, signé do nol make sense by ‘irtue of referetroe bo erie in
