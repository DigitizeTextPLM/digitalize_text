1, CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing
public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase,
the engineering of consent, He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more
than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time bit or miss publicity and
propaganda (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent a different view of
the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, whe views the public as being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amerphous mass which
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1028) offers the idea
that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial. Tt must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, ta the

public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (ip. 46).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presenta public relations as a tee] that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The oheectiveminded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or belps the public arjust to it (Hernays,
1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernaye (1052) writes of the
benefits of public relations, Ta citizens in general, public relations is important because it helpe them
to understand the seciety of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being. made by others,
and to persuade or suggest courses of actlon (p. LD). Under this framework, while manipulation of

the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant lenorance of the publle opinion. Theorists euch as
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this paint.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories deweloped by Lippmann, Lasrwell, Eltul, and Bernays are tmportanit for a temier of

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the direct effects and limited effects

propaganda could directly influence the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, theorista auch ae Lippmann

in the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work of
Ivengar and Kinder, a5 well as McComba and Shaw, Overall, the research af the scholars discussed in
this paper bas been very important to the understanding of the media, the manipulation of the public,
and the formation of public opinion. While the theorkes of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernaye, and Ellul
