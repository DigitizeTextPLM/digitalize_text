Vat [ars igm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 13/4). To some extent, however, functional theory
DO te with media’s effects towards people. For example, a model often used in the the-
ory, the Hy podermie syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential
effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information into the consciousness of the masses” (Watson & Hill 1997, p
105). Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1940s. After that, a shift
which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses
and pratimications approach.

The exploration of gratificatians that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as
empirical mass communication research itself (McQuail, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well
as daily newspaper [L azrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948: etc). In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some sp ecific content or by the medium
itself (Katz et al., 19746). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with acvece,
support, or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared fopics
of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelsan, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratficatans.
