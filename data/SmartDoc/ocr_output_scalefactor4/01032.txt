uted to the development of the field of communication as a whole, This chapter strives to focus

on those theorists who pioneered the research of un certainty reduction in communication. Their work
is crucial to the developm ent of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our
understanding of interpersonal processes.

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of commu

nication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined
and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical tramework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there
Was 4 high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
also contributed te the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the
information theorists as well as Heider (1958) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as
the “number of alternative ways in which each Interactant might behave" (p. 100). The greater the
level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able ta pre
dict behaviors and occurrences. During interactions individuals are nt oat ciel ae
