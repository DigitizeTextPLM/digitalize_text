4 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The iaTz Engligh-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culture industry culaide of a German context. In the years since there have been numer
qu cnicams of the tex, not leas! since Adomo made sweepeng generakzations about “the
commodified and fefshized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adamo erred in not discussing Ihe processes of cul-
tural production, and failed te examine the culture industry's economic dependence on ater
business seclors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, be-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all pervasive reificabon’ (Eagtetan,
4991, p. 48). Stil, Eagieton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliets
among oppressed pacples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys-
bem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1961, p. 36), Fredric Jameson pointed out tat Adomo's idea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the sociaty that developed in the 1980.
and 1970s with new media went beyond the culbural possibilities avaiable during the 1408.
While the idea of the culture industry can be defended aa a useful theory for industrial soci
pies behween 1920 and 1970, trying ta use @ today weakens its efectiveness (Hohendahl,
1995. p. 146-48). Thus, for a aome critics, the value of the Mea of ihe culture industry would
appear io be merely historical, if they in fact conceded thar ithad any walue al all.

Thus for some cilics modenisl works would be counteracting forces againal the dominant
ideclogy. As noted in ihe example of Graon Vvelles. however, it may be fhe case that the
dominant ideology can co-op modernist works for ie own ends, The kee of the culure
