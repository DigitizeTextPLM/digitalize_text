1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culture indusiry outside of a German context In the yeark Bice ihera hawe been nurmer-
ous crticiams of the text, not least since Adoma made sweeping generalizations about “the
commeadified and fetishized character of all cultural goods” [Cook 1996, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cok, Adomo erred in not discussing the processes of cul:
ural production, and faded to exaenine jhe culbure indusiry’s economic dependence on alher
business sectors, including marketing amd advertising (Cock, 1566, p. 4B).

For Tery Eagleton, both Adame and Marcuse overestimated tne dominant ideology, be-
lieving that “capitaliel society languihes in the grip of an all-pervasne feification” (Eagieion,
1951, p. 48). Sil, Eagleton conceded that “the diftuson of dominant values and beliets
among oppressed peoples in socely has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys-
tem a6 a whale” (Eagitton, 1841. p. 38). Fredmc Jameson painted cut thal Adorno’ idea

indusiry, and since he did mot systematically explore how ihe cukure industry operated, it has
been generally easy for some to diamiss the Wea of a culbune industry. It nonetheless be
