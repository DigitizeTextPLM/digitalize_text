State University. For two years during the Koreas War, be served in the U.8, Air Foece. Interestingly,
in 1966, he worked on some finsily planning communipation projects in Korea.

The kook haa become the Handard textbook an diffusion theory and & creas applications of diffu
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, peychology, polatical science, and, as previously
mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Moxico it 20M because he wari
suffering from kidney distase. He died on Oxtober 21, 2005.

According ba Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process. by which am innovation is commu-
nicated chrough certain channels ower line among the meenbers of a scial sysiem. As lemovniion
isan ides, proctice or object perceived as new by an individual or ceher unil od adoption, The diffu-
don of inmeovatioes Involves both miss media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 40%),
That is, by sharing communication channels sch as interpersonsl Come caLon. oT mes COMME
nication people can get information of an innovetion aed perceive m8 innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1048) presented a well-onran model of communication that is sealyred as five parts, S-MeC-R-E

[2-@. sender-message-channel-receiver-eflect). Rogers (1 443) mented, “this S-MeC-R-E conmava-
nication model cooesponds closely to the elements of diffusion” tp. 1) Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication. (4) receivers can be members af # social system, and fireally
(2) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffasion theory, “Tine” variable
is a very important factor. According to Rogers (155) variable is ewolved in diffusion im (1)
the innenvabion-decision process; (2) inmovabrveness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
vnlions have an S-shaped rate of adoplcn. O¥gfusion research has atterysed to explaire the wartabies

There ore five different types of adopters im the diffusion process, aceoeding to Inmavativercss:
“7 1) [eeevetors (verturesome), (2) Early Adopeers (respectable), (7) Early Majority (Deliberaie’, (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (4) Laggands (traditionaly” (Rogers, 10, pp. 1E3-1E5) Rogers defined
this tenn a “the depres to which an weedividual 14 relatively earlier in adopling new idews than ocher
