ee joes to ie (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation 18 commie

sion of innovations invelves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication of mass comumu-
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, §-M-C-R-E
(e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-etfect). Rogers (1995) mentiosed, “this 5-M-C-R-E OUTUITAh=
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19}, Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, “Time’ variable
is a very important factor, According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innevation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attenipted to explain the variables

There are five different types of wlopiers in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
“1h Innovators (veaturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Lute Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined
this term as “lhe degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40%. Figure | shows the relationships betercen types

there are five stapes. oe ees

I. Knowledge + or — (selective exposure or awareness of news)
2, Attitudes + or = (people have positive or Negative attitude toward innovations)
4. Adoption (Decision); people decide to adopt the innovation

4. Implementation (regular or standard practiog)

S. Confirmation (comparing ars evaluating)
