i. BARLY INFLUENCES

Therefore uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal COMmmuUnicatioan.
The following theorists explore how communication can be a vehicle individuals utilize to reduce

uncertainty.

The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1 OTS).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of lowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,

one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a sub-

stantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication, After graduation, initially

worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Insti-

tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin death, Festinger

worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research

(Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed

Lewin’s theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging field of in-

terpersonal communication and on the development of URT. Festinger ts best Known for the theories

Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted to

explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed CDT

in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). CDT allows for three

relationships to opcur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equi-

librium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each

other; and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another
(West & Turner, 2000), Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of arousal and dis-
comfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to
feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual
usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to the self. This need for social comparison can
result in conformity pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, 2004). Berger and Calabrese (1973) related so-
cial comparison to URT by stating that “Pestinger has suggested that persons seek out similar others
who are proximate when they ex perience a high level of uncertainty reg arding the appropriateness of
their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation” (p. 107), Festinger received the Distinguished
Scientist award of the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Senior Scientist
Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger’s legacy is significant, and
his theoretical influence can still be recognized in comtemporary social science research. Aronson (in
Festinger, 1980) stated, “It was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of
cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, social psychology has not been the same since” (p. 3).

1.2 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosaphy from the University of Graz. During his time in
Eurape, Heider worked with nany renowned psychologists such as Wolfgane Kohler Max Wertheimer
and Kurt Lewin, Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin as a substantial impact on his life: “I want
to pay tribute to Lewin stimulating influence, which has affected much of my thinking and which is
still strong even in this book, although it does not derive directly from his work” (Heider, 1958, p.
vii}. In 1929, Heider moved to the United States to work at Smith College and later the University of
Kansas where he worked for the remainder of his life (Ash, 2000),
