Like many other etructuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural linguistics

A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. It 1S the social part ot
language, itis essentially a collactive contract which one mu st accept in its entirety if one
wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently 8 social insti-
tution, In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing Nis personal thought. It is because speach is
essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual act and not to a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the worc
dog in English or in Korean are the extem al forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "l propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifi) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the apposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis
(ed.), p. 37). The correspondence of the conceptmeaning to the external form is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation but the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that "language does
not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from
within itself through @ senes of conceptual and phonic differences”. According ta Saussure, “meaning
is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic
(2.9. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (é.9., synonyms), organized into a signifying system" (Barker
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the pete
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic communi
members, Foran example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the foll ey
ing sentence: “| went to a theater with my girlfriend." This sentence is established th x sagt’
linear combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as | theater, my, and girlfri Te ie
