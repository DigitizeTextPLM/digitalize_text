1, THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in
Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative
in Europe. The closest thing in Adornea experience to the advertising industry in the United States
was fascist propaganda (Jijger, 20M, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience with
the Princeton Radio Hesearch Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical
division of consumers, amd stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Lasarafeld and Adorno did
not agres on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adornos dissatisfaction with
the work of the Princeton Radia Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop
the idea of the culture industry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adoma, popular culture on fli and radia did not bother to present itself as art, They were instead
a business, and this in turn besumnr an ideology te legitimize the tragh they intentionally produce
{Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitalism, In which massa production based on the techalgues weed by Henry Ford were implemented im
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based an centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl,
1995, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adormowere the Hollywood production system, or
the CES radio network that bad been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songe were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
2002, p. $4). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system,
and that nothing truly adversarial ta the system would emerge [Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p.
106-7]. Paradoxically, any innovation would only reattirm the system, and Adorno clted Oraen Welles
as an mouople af eomecne who was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would
allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual
(Friedman, 1981, p. 165), Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
of social control (Forkheimes wid Adare, 2002, p. 120), but freedom te choose in a system of economic
coercion ultimately meant the ee Sy ate the came |Horkhelmer and Adorno

Adorn specifically defines heim art a8 the wibversary of the antics Peete (Horkheimer and
Adora, 2002, p. LOL). It was not high art that Adorno was presenting as an alternative to the culture
industry, but modernism. Although he provides the idea of an opposing force to the culture industry,
Adorno provides no avert Marxist analysis. Instead, he notes in pasting that the dominant system
utilized capacities for mass consumption for entertainment or amusement,

Since Adorno bad been, in his essays on music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, The
Culture Industry has been criticized as being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture.
Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and
Adora, 2008, p. 101}.
