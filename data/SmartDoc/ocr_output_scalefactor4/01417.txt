1, THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in
Europe. Farther, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative
in Europe. The closest thing in Adornos experience to the advertising industry in the United States
was fascist propaganda (Jager, 2004, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience with
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did
not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adornos dissatisfaction with

the wark of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop
the idea of the culture industry.

Because of the relationship between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University,
Horkheimer, who had already mowed to California, could not bring Adorno to the West Coast until
November 1941. When Adorno was finally alle to relocate, he joined an expatriate community that
included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Hisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Déblin, and
Bertolt Brecht, several of which found work in the Hollywood movie industry. The fact that Adorno
was part of this intellectual community whose members were involved in the production of Hollywood
movies must have had some influence in developing his thoughts on culture, since the Hollywood aystem
inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany.

These preconditionsAdornoes interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the
relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important te an understanding of
his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were baged on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl,
1995, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adornowere the Hollywood production system, or
the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songe were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work [Horkheimer and Adorn,
9002, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the syetem,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge [Horkheimer andl Adorno, 2002. Bp.
106-7}. Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, mat] Adorno cited Oreon Welles:
as an example of somenne who was allowed te break the rules. The elasticity in the syatem would
allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual
(Friedman, 1951, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry WEE ALL inatrumentt
of social control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom bo choose in a system of economic
coercion ultimately meant the freedom to be the same (Horkhemer aunt Adorno, 2002, p. Ho

Adorno provides no overt Marxist analysis. Instead, he notes in passing that the dominant system
