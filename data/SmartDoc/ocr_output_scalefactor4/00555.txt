Uses and Gratifications

4.1. Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media research. The orginal
conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of
certain media contents. The core question of such research is: Why do people use media
and what do they use them for? (McQ uail, 1983). There exists a basic idea in this approach:
audience members know media content, and which media they can use to meet their needs.
In the mass communication process, uses and gratifications approach puts the function of
linking need gratifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience members. It
suggests that people's needs influence what media they would cnoose, how they use cer-
tain media and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs from other
theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users as opposed to
passive receivers of information, In contrast to iraditional media effects theories which focus
on “what media do to peo ple” and assume audiences aré homogeneous, uses and gratifica-
tions approach is more concerned with “what people do with media” (Katz, 1959). It allows
audiences personal neads to use media and responds to the media, which determined by
their social and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates
that the media compete with other information sources for audience s need satisfaction (Katz
at al., 1974a). As traditional mass media and new media continue fe provide people with a
