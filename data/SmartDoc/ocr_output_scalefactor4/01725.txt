: ‘Adorno was at Oxford from 1934 to 1938, where be worked on a manuscript on Hussert. He was conslde red
an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainsireasn, and hee lovked forward to joining his Frank
furt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved ts the United States. Already in the late
19305 Adore evidenced little hope for mass culture, As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adomo debated mass culture, since film and radia became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships, The essay translated as “Qn the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect 2 pessimistic reply 10 Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Ar in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p, 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adore lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard over the radia, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adomo was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milicu
impossible” (Adorno, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation fram hierarchical tastes ted to class, to Adorno, the aura of the original artwork was the
eseential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea- io down of layers of imitations: to Adama, mass
production wea mothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adore. In 1998 lax Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in
New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, run by Paul Lazars-
feld. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although he later claimed that he did not know what a “radio project” was, For his part,
Lazarstchd looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he koew to be an expert on music, ok dest
wrote for the Project's journal in 1941, reiterating his position that rodia was only an image of a live perfor
mance. In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio industry that the medium was bringing serious music
to the masses (Wipgerchaus, 4p. 243) While working at the Princeton Radio Rese h Project Adorno
became shocked al the degree to which culture had become commercialized in the United States, _

Adoni was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the twa theorists became friends. Since Benjamin
