1 Other Propaganda Theorists
1.1 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

(Rogers, 1954).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research, He focused on
conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda,

Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Laswell (1945) aims to
achinve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that runs from control to content and from content
th audience” [p. 74)

This method of coment analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1959) early definition of communication which |
