Uses and Gratifications

1.1. Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media research. The original
conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of
certain media contents. The core question of such research is: Why do people use media
and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1963). There exists a basic idea in this approach:
audience members know media content, and which media they can use to meet their needs,
In the mass communication process, uses and gratificatons approach puts the furietion of
linking need gratifications and madia choice clearly on the side of audience members. It
suggests that people's needs influence what media they would choose, how they use cer-
tain media and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs from other
elical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users a3 opposed to
sere eerie of information. in contrast to traditional media effects theories ih a
