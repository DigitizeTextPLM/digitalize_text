1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1872 English-language trarvialion marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culture indusiry auiside of a German contest. Im the years since then haves been mumer-
ous criticisms of the text, not lesel since Adora made sweeping generalizations aout “the
cammodified and fetishized character of all culbural goods” (Cook, 1696, p. 113). For the
generally sympathets Deborah Cook, Adenia erred in not discussing the processes. of cul-
tural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business seciors, induding marketing and adveriaing (Soom, 1996, p. 48). ;

For Teery Eagleton, both Adamo and Marcuse overestimated trea dominant ideology. be-
ligving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervative reification’ (Eagleton,
1991, p. 46). Shll, Eagleton conceded that “the diffuaion of Gaminant values and belts
among oppressed peogles in sociely has some par to play in the reproduction of the tya-
lem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1891, p. 38). Fredric Jameson pointed out thal Adomma's idea
of a culture industry wae historically limited, since the society that ceveloped mi the 19605
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural podaibiliies available during the 16408.
While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for induetnal soci-
glies bebween 1920 and 1970, trying ta wee # today weakens ibs affective ness (Hobendahl,
