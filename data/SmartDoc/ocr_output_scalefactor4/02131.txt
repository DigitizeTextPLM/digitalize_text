the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Kate is one of the most well-known
uted greatly to establishing the stracture of the approach.
TG hoee en fea EE and asa communication researcher, He received his Ph.D. in 30-
ciology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicage until 1963, During
the newt thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. in the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s to1390s (UPENN, 2001). In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Kate's mentorin Columbia University is Paul Lararsfeld, whole one ofthe pioneers of grathications research.
Thelr cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of pratifications with the
functional theory model, Later, Ratz intraduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
netion that peaple we the media to their benett. Ina study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject
whichis known as the uses dnd pratifications research were explored. They viewed the mass media at a means
by which individuals connect or disconnect themaelves with others and found that people bend the media ta
their needs more readily than the media averpower them (Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published & collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 which
were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication. They took a more humanistic approach to looking at nedia
use, They suggest that media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the user and
they have alternate choices to satisfy their need. (Blumler & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that media

served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission for both society
and Individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974).
