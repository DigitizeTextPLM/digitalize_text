tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamies. After Lewin death, Festin
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
(Samelson, 2000), Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging field of in-
terpersonal communication and on the development of URT. Festinger is best known for the theorles
of Sogunavs Diszonance and Social Comparison, Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted ta
explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed CDT
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groupe (Festinger, (982). CDT allows for three
relationships t0 occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equi=
librium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each
other; and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another
(West & Tumer, 2000). Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of arousal and cis
comfort that individuals seck to reduce, Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to
feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual
usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to the self. This need for social comparison can
result in conformity pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, 2004), Berger and Calabrese (1975) related so-
cial comparison ta URT by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons seek out similar others
who are proximate when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of
their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation” {p. 107). Festinger received the Distinguished
Scientist award of the American Psychological Association und the Distinguished Sentor Scieatist
Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger’s legacy is significant, ane
his theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary gocial science research. ana (im
Festinger, 1980) stated, “It was in this era that Leon Festinger itverted ra fa tae ome of
cognitive dissonance, and in my opinian, social psychology has not been the same since 4p. ~!-
