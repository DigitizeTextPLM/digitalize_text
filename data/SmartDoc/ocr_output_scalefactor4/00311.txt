1.1 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In
fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was at tually being written by Lippmann h imselt

(Rogers, 19944).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area

symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience 's opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the coment of the message, Lasswell (1946) alms to

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1953) early detinition of communication which

stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects” (p. 84). Content analysis Was ESSen-

shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. Im this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it However, it is still that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to | ippimann's theories.

1.2 Edward Bermays (1891-1995)
@ public opinion and propaganda,

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining
Edward Bemays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion, Bernays (1928)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events 00 influence the relations of a
public to an enterprise, idea, or group (p. 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bemays recognizes
that propaganda can be either beneticial or harmful to the public. Tt can help individuals decide what to think
about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to soclery’s functioning as a whole.
Bernays states, “We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by

men we have never heard of... Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live

together as a smoothly functioning society (p a)

Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be modified, and that such shaping is a necessary part of
society, Bernays pursued his work in the field of public relations. "Public relations is the attempt, by information,
persuasion, and adjustment, to engineer public support for an activity, cause, MovVEMent, or institution” (Bemays,
1955, p. 3). Inthe Engineering of Consent, Bernays (1955) loys out the framework for understanding the public

and its litnrts a public relations campaign. Bemays (1955) claims that the key to a successful public relations
campaign is adjustment of the campaign to the attitudes of various groups in society, gathering information
to effectively express an idea, and finally, utilizing persuasion to influence the public opinion in the intended

direction.
Bernays’ theories represent a step forward for mass communication theory. They move away from more

typical presentations of “hit-or-miss propaganda,” and move toward a deeper
