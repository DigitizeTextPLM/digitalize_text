A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values, itis the social part of
language, it is escentially a collective contract which ane must ecoent in its entinaty if one
wishes to communicate. tis because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming fram a single individual and ls consequenily a social inst
tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is assentially
@n individual act of selection and actualization. The Speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. Itis bacause apeech is
essentially a combinative activity that it cormesponds to and individual act and notte a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1987, pp, 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system inte two parts, the
signified and the signifier The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the fon.
The form is called ihe signifier, which is the extemal part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the extemal forms expressing the actual animal dog, Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. “| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifie) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicailng the opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts” (Saussure, 1959, in F. Innis
fed, p. 37). The correspondence of ihe conceptimeaning to the extemal form le notin the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. Itis mot the inevitable internal relation but the diferense
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that ‘language aoe

within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences®. Acoonding to Saussure, Hal
