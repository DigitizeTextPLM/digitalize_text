| Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was In fluenced by Saussure structural linguistics j
| To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation j
| by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set |
of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which compose |
it; as opposed to it, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language" (Barthes, 1967,
p.13). Barthes intanprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level,
langue, is the social convention or value shared through a society which i stabilized and standardized
On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However,
it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the
shared convention, ie structure. -

} \anguage is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values, Itis the social part of

language, itis essentially a collective contract which ene must accept in its entirety iFone
wiehes to communicate. itis because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming fram a single individual and is consequently a Social insh-
tution. In contrast te language, which is both institution and system, speach is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code

of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because apeach if

essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to ana individual act and not fo a pure
creation. (Bares, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes ihe language system inte two parts, the
signified and the signifier The signified is a concept or meaning wnecn is expressed through the form.
The form ts called the signifier, which is the extemal part of language. For éxample, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the extemal forrns expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified, "| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified {signihé) amd
| signifier (significant); the last fwo tenms have the advantage of indicating tee opposition that sepa-
] rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parte” (Saussure, 7959, in Fi. lnnis
| fed), p. 37). The correspondence of the concept'meaning fo the external farm & not in the destined
| relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. tis not the inevitable internal relation but the differance
| bebanen the signs that operates the signifying system. Sauseure (1960) argues that language does
not reflect a pre-existent and external realty of independent oipects, but constructs meaning frost
within Heel through 4 series of conceptual and phonic difgrences”. According te Saussure, "meaning
is produced through 4 process of selection and combination of signe along two aes, the syntagmatc
(e.g. a sentence} and the paradigmate (6.9., synonyms), organized into a signifying system” (Barker,
S002, p. 29). As 4 grammatical set of signe of the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means 8 field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite varhous possibilities in aelacting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is alsa regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. Foran caample of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the follow-
ing sentence: “l went te a theater with my girlfriend. This sentence it established through the
linear combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as | theater, my, and girlfriend can be
substitubed for by olher signs inthe paradigmatic, such as “She went to a restaurant with her mother
] Through the eyriagmatic and ihe paradigmatic, Saussure tells wa that signs are opersied anh when
they are related to each other ‘Crucially, signs do mot make sense by virtue of reference to enbiies in
an Independent object weeld; rather, they generate meaning by reference ta gach otter Thue, meen
ing ig understood a6 @ socal comvention organized through the relations bebeeen signs’ (Barker, C.
1 | 2002, p. 29), “Itis central ta Saussures argurment that red is meaningful in relation te the ditterenon
7 ] between red, green, amber, atc, These signs are then organized into & sequeios which generates
1 | meaning through the cultural conventions of their usage within a particular context.
