society, but atill also claims that manipulation of the public is peealble. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helpe them
ta understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to periuade or suggest courses of action (p, 10}. Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still pasaible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theenes developed by Lippmann, Dasrwell, Biiul, and Bernays are tmportant for a number of

The theories presented in this paper have tled heavily ta both the direct effects and limited effects
media models, Theorists such as Ellul tended to side beavily with the direct effects model, whereby
propaganda could directly influence the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippmann
aleo noted that the media might not be influencing only thought, but may also be influencing what
People thought about, Tt was this line of thinking that resulted In a starting point for future research
in the ares of the limited effects of the media, Such limited effects were shown through the work af
Tyengar and Kinder, a5 well a: McCombs and Shaw. Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in
this Paper has been very important to the understanding of the media, the manipulation of the public
and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays. and Ellul
were formed years ago, they coftinue ta help us understand the sockety that surrounds te ope
