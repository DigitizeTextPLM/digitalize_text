In Order to Measure certain variables” (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled "Contents of Communication,"
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content inalysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols iy to persuade the audien e's opinion, and
the intensity of the symbels used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1945) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that runs from central to content and from coneent
to audience" (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Laswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with whar effects’ (p. 64), Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the
remainder of his career.

Aside trom understanding the content of propaganda, Lasewell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. [his is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories,

1.2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

Aut approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion, Bernays (1928)
defines propaganda a5, a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape evers to influence the relations of a
public to an enterprise, idea, or group (p. 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bemays recognizes
that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public. It can help individuals decide what to think
about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to society's functioning as a whole.
Bemays states, "We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by
men we have never heard of... Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manmer if they are to live
together as a smoothly functioning society (p. 3). . es

Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be mosiitied, and that such shaping is a necessary part pi
society, Bernays pursued his work in the field of publicr lations, "Public relations is the at sei by information,
persuasion, and adjustment, to engineer public support for an activity, cause, mov een, OF institutions ee
1955, p. 3). In the Engineering of Consent, Bernays (1955) lays out the framework pale 5 ee roel dasien
