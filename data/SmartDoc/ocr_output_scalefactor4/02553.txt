1. Early Influences

The fellowing theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in eommunseation.
The influence of their week cam be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1475).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied peychology at the Liniwersity of hows under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,
one of the founders of social prychology and & pacneer in the research of group dynamics, had a sab-
gantial inflvence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, imitialty
worked af the University of Rochester, bat in 1944 he followed Lewin to Massachesctts [neti-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dvnamics. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford Liniversity, and the New Schoo! for Social Research
(Samelson, 2M. hack of Festinger’s cestarch folknwed fii mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin's iheorles. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging, feeld of ie
terpersanal communication and on the development of WRT. Fest scram for the theories
of Cognitive Dissonance and Sota conpitison. Cognitive Dissonance (CTT) aitempeed to
explain how an imbalance among cognitins might affect an individoal. Lewin foreshadowed CDT
in his cheervations regarding attitude change im sonal groupe (Festanper. p82). CVT allows for three
relationships to oocar ameng Cognit: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions ane in equi-
librium with each other, a dissonant relationship, i which cognitions are i competition with each
wiher; and on intelevant relotionshap, an which the cognilicess in question have no effect on one another
(West & Turner, 2HHN. Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, had an element of arousal and dis-
comfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individwals look bo
feedback from ethers 10 evaluate their performance amd abilities, To evaluate the self, the individual
usually seeks the opieions of pihera who ere slmnilar to the self. This need for social exenparison can
result In comfoermily pressures (Tresholm & Jensen, 2M}. Benger and Calabrese (1475) related so-
cial comparison bo LIFT hey stationyg that “Festinger has suggested that parsons sek crt srmmilar others
who one prouimate when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the approprimencss od
their behavior andor opinion ina particular situation” (p LOT). Festinger recelwed the Thistingwished
Scientist award of the American Prychological Association and the Distinguished Senior Scientist
Aeard from ihe Society af Experimental 500i Psychology Festinger’s legacy is significant, anal
his theoretical influence can anil be recognized in comemporary socal schenoe research. Aronson (im
Festinger, 1760) stated, “Is wens in this era thet Leos Pestieger inverted are developed iis theory of
cogniaive dissonance, and in my opinien, socal peychobegy inas not heen ihe sane since” ip. 3.
