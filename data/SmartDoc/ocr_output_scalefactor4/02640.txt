that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms artes. ate

made amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims,
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 66). F

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations a5 & toul mist can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader, The ohjective-minded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helpe the public adjust to it (Bernays,
1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the eociety of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade or suggest courses of action (p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasewell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of
reasons, Based on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann was able fo bring attention to the fact that
the public is able ta be influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and hia colleagues hos led to more
recent research that is meant to help understand the influence of the media on the public. Through the
work Iyengar and Kinder, White, Lewin, and McCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensive understanding
of the media fos been developed. The public has now been mode aware vortows media functions such as
agendo-sefting, gatekeeping, and priming, and the potential effects that these fechniques can have on
fherr cudiences.
The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the direct effects and limi
media models. Theorists such as Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct effects ee
propaganda could directly influence the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, theorists such as eres
also noted that the media might not be influencing only thought, but may also be influencing what
people thought about. It was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting point for future 2 arch
in the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shoam through th ae
Iyengar and Kinder, as well as MeCombs and Shaw, Overall, the research of the schol pa ines
