1930s Adomo evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adomo debated mass culture, since film and radio became the hwo most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art inthe Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 195%, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adora lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adomo was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adomo, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation trom hierarchical tastes tied te class, to Adorno, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical re production was the ¢ hallenge avainst the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea to down of layers of imitations: to Adorno, mass
prvduction was mvhing but the destruction of the authenticity, The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adorno. In 1938 Max Horkheimer, whe had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in
New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, run by Paul Lava rs-
feld. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although he later claimed that he did not know what a “radio project™ was. For his part
