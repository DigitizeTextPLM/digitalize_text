Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two hae the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the extemal part of language For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "I propose ta retain the word sign So a
