1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncemainty has bees bdencified as an impoclan construct, necessary to the study of commu-
nication, it would be beneficial oo ken when the concept originated, and how it has heen defined
and studied. Ome way to comsider uncertainty is theough the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed thal unceraincy existed ina gives clpuatios when there
was a high amount of possible aliermatives amd the probabiliry of their event was relatively equal
Shannon and Wi rrelated this view of uncertainty bo the transmission of messages, bul their work
also contrituted tothe deweogment of LRT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the
information theorists as well as Heider (1955) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded che concept of uncertainty 10 fit interpersonal coonmunication oy defining uncenaincy a
the “number of alternative ways in which each interact might behave” (p. LOO. The greater the
level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individeals will be able to pre-
dict behavbars and cocurrences. During interactions: individuals are not only faced with problems of
predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why pariners betave or beliewe in the way
thar they do, Berger and Bradac’s (1902) definition of uncertaieey highlighted the complexity af this
process when they stated; “Uncestainty, then, cam stem from the lange number of mhecnacive sings
that a stranger can believe or potentially say" Uncertainty plays a shenificane role when exacraning
