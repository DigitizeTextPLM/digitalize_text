gratifications approach is suggested to be originally st
: 1 . 7 " ed i
tionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler rt ear

act & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional th
on communication agrees with media’s effects towards people. For exampl oe
ory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that

e, a model often used in the the-
"the mass media have a
effect upon audiences by ‘injecti ng’ information inte t

direct, immediate and influential
he consciousness of the masses” (Watson & Hill 1997, p.
105). Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1940s. After that, a shit
which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to esta blishment of uses
and gratifications approach.
The exploration of gratifications that motivate peaple to be attracted to ce
empirical mass communicatio

rtain media is almost as old as
n research itself (McQuail, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio program mes, such a5 soap operas and quizzes, as well

as daily newspa

per (Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc). In these
etudies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by same specific content oF by the medium

itself (Katz et al., 197 4b). For instance, radio soap operas Were found to satisfy their listeners with advice,
support, or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be im portant to give readers a sense of security, shared topics

of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has growin
up. Some basic assumphions of the approach were pro posed when it was rediscovered during that era. AMONE
