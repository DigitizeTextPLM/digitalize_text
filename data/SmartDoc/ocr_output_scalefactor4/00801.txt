According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers ti “the process: by which an innovation is commu-

nicated through certain channels over lite: among the memibe ofa aecial syste. As Limovaiion
is an ides, proctice or object perceived as mew hy am individual or other unit of adoption, The diffu:

There ore five different types of adopters in the diffusios process, accoeding to inmavativencss:
(1) [emovetors (venturesome), (2) Early Adopaers (respectable), (7) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (4) Laggards (traditional (Rogers, 1994, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined
this tenm a8 “the degree oo which an tedividual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than coher
memberd of his social system” (Rogers, 195, p, 40). Figure | shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innowaliveness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories
