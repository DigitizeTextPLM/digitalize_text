1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has heen identified a5 an important CONSIHUC, Necessary tO the stucly af commu

nication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined
and studied. One way to consider uncertaincy is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there
was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
also contributed to the development of URT, Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the
information theorists as well as Heider (1958) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as
the “number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 100). The Breater the
