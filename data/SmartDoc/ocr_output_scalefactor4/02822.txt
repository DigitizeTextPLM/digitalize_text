Like mary other structuralist scholars, Barthes wae influenced by Saussure structural linguistics

To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates an twa levels, the systematic system and the variation
by speaking actors. The former ip called langue and the later parol. Langue is fhe sysleratized set
of conventions necessary to communication, indiferent to the maternal of the tignal which compope
it as opposed to A, speech (parcie) is covers the purely individual part of language” (arthes, 1967
p.13), Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure lewel,
langue, is the social comvention of walle shared through 4 society which it slabiized and shandardined
On the contrary, parce is fesxible because it is the actual expression at the individual lawel, However,
its considered relativety flexiplé due to the fact that speech by an) individual cannot be free form the
shared convention, the structure

A language is therefore, -a social institution and a syster of wailed. It is te social part of
language, iLis essentially & collective contract which one musi acospt in ite entirety tone

wishes to communicate. [tis because a language is a systeen of vonitrachual varhoes that i
resists Ihe modifications coming trom a single individual and ts consequently a social ingl+
tuffon. In contrast to language, which ié both institution and ayshem, sgeech is aesentaly
an individual act of selection and actualaation The speaking subject can wee the code
af the language with a wieew to empeessirmg his personal thougt. is because speech 16
assentially a combina activity thal it comeaponds to and indivaiua at and not lo a pure
erention. (Barthes, 1957, po. 14-18)

Focusing on the systematic level, Saunurre distinguiehes the language system into ee parts, the
segnified and te signifier. Then signified i a conceplar meaning which is expressed throug" the form.
The form is called the signifier, which & fre external part of language. For saampl, both the weed
