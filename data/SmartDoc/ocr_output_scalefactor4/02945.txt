propaganda (Bernays, 1955, p22), Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent a different view of
khee formation of public opinion, In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernaye, 1928, p. ff). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea
that in abtempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial. Tt must explain itself, its alms, its objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. GB).
Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presente public relations as a tool that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations
moan helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, oF helps the public adjust ta it [Hernays,
1952, p. 9}. Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a pact, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modilying conditions that aifecte us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade of suggest ores af action {p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation af
the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such a8
Lippmann and Ebel tended to disagree with this point.
