itself (Katz et al. 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisty thelr pee with i WIDE,
support, or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 144; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than aaa
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, sha red topics
of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s tll 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era, Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach,

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in So-
ciology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Cammunication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. lin the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This expenence led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s tol990s (UPENN, 2001). In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and alsa directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Kates mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsteld, whois one of the pioneers of gratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
nation that people use the media to their benefit. ina study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a sublect
which is known as the uses and gratifications research were explored. Th ey viewed the mass media as a means
by whieh individuals can nect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media ta
thelr needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay G, Elumler, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 which
were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication, They took a more humanistic approach ta (ooking at media
use. They suggest that media users seek out a medium source that bes
