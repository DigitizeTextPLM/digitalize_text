i. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five hasic assumptions were stated in a study of Katz, Blumler, and Gureviteh in 1974 as follows.
They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media and audiences:

1. The audience is conceived as active, i.e., an important part of of mass media use is

assumed to be goal oriented ... patterns of media use are shaped by more or less

definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience
member.

2. Inthe mass communication process much initiative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on

theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and
behavior.

3, The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
Tass communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs,

and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consump-
tion certainly varies.

4. Methodologically speaking. many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- Le., people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in
particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal fonmulation.

5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own tens. (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumles, and Gureviteh also commented that, although previous researches on
pratificutions deqected diverse gratifications tbat attract people on the media, they did not address the
connections between these pratifications (Kate et al, 197?4a). They suggested that uses and gpratifi-
cations research concern with following aspects: “(1) the social and the psychological origins af (2)
needs which generar (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) die
ferential exposure (OT engaping in other activities), resulting in (5) need gratification amd (7) other
consequences, perhaps sostly hnintended anes" (Katz et al., 1974b, p- 20). The studies of Katz and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the uses and gratifications approach. Since
then, the research on this subject has been strengthened ancl extended. The current status of uses and
pratifications is still based on Mate"s first analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in
such an electronic information age when people have more options of media use.
