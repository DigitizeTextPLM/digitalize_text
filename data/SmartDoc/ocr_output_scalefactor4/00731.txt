1 Early Influences

The following theovists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in commanicatsin.
The influence af their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

lia Festinger studied paychuligy a tbe: University of lowa under the direction of Kurt Lew. Lewin,
one of the founders of social peychology and a pooncer in the research of group dynamics, had a sub-
stantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After gradw@ation, initially
worked af ihe University of Rochester, bat in 145 be followed Lewin to Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked al the University of Michigan, Stanford Universiny, and che New School for Social Research
(Samelsoe, 21MM, Much of Festinger’s research followed his menor Lewin and further developed
Lewin'’s theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influemtial on the emerging field of m-
tenpersonal commvunication and on the development of LRT. Festinger is best known for the theories
of Cagnilivg Diss and al Comparson. Cognitive Dissonance theary (CDT) attempted to
esplain how an bevhalanc: among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed CDT
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982), CDT allows for three
Pelilionshaps lo occur among cognitions: a consomant relaticeship, in which cognitions are in equi-
fibrramn with each inher a ant lationship. in which cognitions are in competition with each
other; and am irrelevant relationshap, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another
(West & Tumer, 2000), Cognitive Dissonance, like uncerwinty, has an element of arousal and dis-
foenfort that individuals seek to reduce, Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals lock te
feedback from others io evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual
weailly socks the opinions of others who are similar to the self This need for social comparison can
result in conformity pressures (Trenholm a& Jensen, 2004), Berger and Calobrese (1975) relaned! an-
cul comparison to URT by sisting that “Festinger hes suggested chat persons seek cat samilar cahers
who are pronumate when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of
their behavior andor opinions ina paniculir aitustion” tp. WT), Festinger received the Distinguished
Scsentist award of the American Psychological Assicci and the Distinguished Senior Schentiad
Awrurd from tee Society of Experimental Social Psychology, Fesinger's legacy is significant, and
his theceetical influence can sill be recognized in Cone porary social schenee research nas ies
Peetiaeker, LGU) stated, “tt was i ra that Leon Festinger inverted and developed his thenwry ar
engnitive dissonance, and in ery opinion, social paychology has mot been the same since” ins
