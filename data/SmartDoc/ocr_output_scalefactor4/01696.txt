a Katz is Brine ficth as a sociologist and asa communication researcher, He received his Ph.O. in S0-
ciology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963, During
the newt thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. in the late 1960), invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication fram the 1970s §19905 (UPENN, 2001). In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Kate's mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, who ls one of the pioneers of gratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of pratifications with the
functional theany model, Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
notion that people use the media to their benett. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject
whichis known as the uses and pratifications research were explored. They viewed the mass media asa means
by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media te
their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 which
were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication, They took a more humanistic approach to looking at media
use. They suggest that media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the user and
they have alternate choices to satisfy their need. (Blumler & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that media

served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission for both society
and Individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974).
