1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs fa biel mem
bers, Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different peaple can use the same communication mes
sage for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different |
individuals. There is not only one way that people uses media. Contrarily, there aré as many reasons
for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).
Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and
education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their
needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their owm motives and Bratifications
for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person
interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape fram routine ar
problems; emotional release; (27) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (2) Personal
identity: self reference; reality exploration; value reinforces: and (4) Surveillance (forms of informa
tion seeking)
Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was iUggested by McGuire (1974), based
on & general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus
“internal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “grewth" and “preservation”
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1}. Figure 1, 4

(1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and paycholoagical functions of the mass med ia and
