The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creats applications of diffu-
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously

sulfering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005.
; According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu-
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu-
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-C-R-E
(¢.¢., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this S-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 15). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, “Time variehle
is a Very important factor, According to Rogers (1995), time variable 15 involved in didtusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness, (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption Diffusion research has attempted fa expain ety sonar
