the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to farther develop
the idea of the culture industry.

Horkhermer, who had already moved ta Califarnia, coud not bring Adorno to the West Coast until
November 1941. When Adarno was finally alle fo relocate, he joined an expatriate community fat
