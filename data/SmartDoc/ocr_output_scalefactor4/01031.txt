1 Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication. |
The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1973).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)
Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of lowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin.
one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a sub-
stantial influence on the developarent of interpersonal communication. After praduation, initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
(Samelson, 20). Bluch of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging field of in-
erpersonal communication and on the development of URT, Fe stinger is best known for the theories
of Cognitive Dissonance and Social ¢ comparison, Cagnilive Dissonance theory (COT) attempted to
explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed CDT
in his observations regarding: attitude change in small groupe (Festinger, 1982). COT allows for three
relationships TO OCCuT EAMOne cognitions: & consonant relation ship, in which COsMMONS are in equi-
| Werium Wilh each mher: a dissonant relationship, in whieh cognitions are in COMPpctition with each
| other, and an imeclevant relationship, in which the CODnItions In question have no effect on one another
(West & Tumer, 2000, Copnitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of arousal and dis
