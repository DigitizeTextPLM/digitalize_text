itself (Katz at al., 19746). For instance, radio soap operas were found to entiaty their listeners with advice,
support, oF Octcasions for emotional release (Hertog, 1944; Wanner and Heney, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and @ structure to the daily routine (Beretson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “pratiications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 19506 tll 1970s when television has grown
up. S0me basic assumptions of thee approach were proposed when it was redincovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and pratitications research, Elihu Katz is ane of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz if Served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received he Ph.D. in So-
clology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Oepartment of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem, In the late 1960, invited by the Government of Grael, Katz headed the task force charged
with the Intreduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s fol 50s (UPERM, 2001). bn
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennéylvania, and also directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study ;

Kate’s mentor in Calurnbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, who is ane af the pioneers of gratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept af gratifications with the
functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
notion that people use the media to their benefit, Ins study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1972), a subject
