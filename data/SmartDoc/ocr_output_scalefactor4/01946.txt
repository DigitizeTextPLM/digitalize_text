4 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 4972 Engliahtanguage translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culture industry outside of a German contest. In the years since there have been numer
ous erifeigms of the text, not least since Adomo made sweeping generalizabons about “the
