That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication Or Mass commu:
ication people can get information of an innevation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-(C-R-E
(e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-cffect), Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this S-M-C-R-E commu
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, amd finalby
(3) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time* variable

is a very important factor, According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)

the innovalion-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Difficcion research haw attempted to explain the variables
that influence how and why wers and audience adopt anew information medium, such os the Internes.
According to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even tha tach ire te
past the individeal is usually the unit of analysis. Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in
adopting new media because new media are interactive tools and thus are required by many users fo
gain efficiency. That is, the more people use, the more people get benefits. Jn this sense, diffusion
theory nat only can apply te practical things, bur alse con he related to digital divide.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
“(1) Innovators (vVenturesome), (2) Earhy Adopters (respectable), (3) a Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-1 eo ran

there are five stages.
I. Knowledge + or - (selective exposure of awareness of news)
Attitudes + or — (people have positive or negative attitude toward innovations)

Adoption (Decision): people decide to adopt the innovation
4. Implementation (regular or standard practice}
