1. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had fone far beyond anything be had seen in
Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative
in Europe. The closest thing in Adornes experience to the advertising industry in the United States
was fascist propaganda (Jager, 20d, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience with
the Princston Radio Research Project in the essay on ¢he culture industry by noting the atatistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did
nob agres on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adornos dissatisfaction with
the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop
the idea of the culture industry,

his concern for the ides of the culture industry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself.as art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology ta legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based ao what Adore referred to as Fordist
capitalise, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and Iderarchy (Hohendahl,
1995, p. 142]. Examples of thisnot specified by Adornowere the Hollywood production ayetem, or
the CTS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Praject. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplant: the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
2002, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would nat be any rea] change te the system,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkbeimer and Adorno, ste a
