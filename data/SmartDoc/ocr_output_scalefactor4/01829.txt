i. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic assumptions were stated ina study of Katz, Blurnler

They provide a framework for understanding the and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows,

correlation between media and audiencis:

L. The audience is conceived as active, [.e,, an important part of of mass media use is
assumed to be goal oriented ... patterns of media use are shaped by more or less

see expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience
mercer

i. In the mass communication process much initiative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on
theorizing about any form of straighe-line effect of media content on attitudes and
behavior,

. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
mass Communication constinute but a segment of the wider range of human needs,
and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consump.
tion certainly varies.

. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- ic., people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in
particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation,

| Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience orientathons are explored om their own terms. (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumer, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous researches on
gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people on the media, they did mor address ne
connections between these gratifications (Katz et al., 1a74a}. They suggested that uses and Seo
