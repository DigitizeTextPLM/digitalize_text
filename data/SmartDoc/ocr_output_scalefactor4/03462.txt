benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them

Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this poalnt.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Losewell, Elid, and Bernays are important for a number of
reasons, Based on the ideas of hie predecessors, Lippmann was able to bring affention to the fact that
the public is able to be infiteenced by the media, The work of Lippmann and hig colleagues haa led bo more

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily ta both the direct effects and limited effects
media models. Theorists such as Ellul tended to cide heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
propaganda could directly influence the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippmann
also noted that the medla might oot be influencing only thought, but may aleo be influencing what
people thought about. [f was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting Point for nines atench
