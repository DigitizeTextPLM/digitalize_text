entitled low to Look at Television that wae the result of a stwdy that had been done for the
Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerboer and others. In this eeay Adorno

of psychological comtral (Adormo, 20a, p. 160). [t was one of the few occasioes in the 1f5is
that Adorno would discuss the implications of mess culewre. Ac keast one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of bis day did mot take part in caltural developments
