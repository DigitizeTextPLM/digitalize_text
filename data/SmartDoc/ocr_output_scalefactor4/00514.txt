ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of the culture
industry has had an importance in critical theory since its appearance in the 7940s, in that
it has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation to ideology, and
hence, society. Since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about the impact of the culture
industry, and since he did not systematically explore how the culture industry operated, it has
been generally easy for some to dismiss the idea of a culture industry. [tis nonetheless the

case that motion pictures are still made by large companies and that their movies largely rely
on formulaic plots. It 1s also the case that radio Is increasingly controlled by a small number
of companies, whic how stations operate. As a broadcast
medium, television is very much related to both radia and film, and snares with them qualities

A reexamination of the idea of the culture industry may be necessaly in order to theorize on
how mass communication media propagale dominant ideologies.
