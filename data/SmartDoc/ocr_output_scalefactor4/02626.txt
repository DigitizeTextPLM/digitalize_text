mass communication constitue but a segment of the wider range of human nerds,
aired the degree to which they cam be adequately met through mass media consump
thom certainly varies.

Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audiemce members themselves- Le., people
are sulfichenaly self-aware to be able to report their interests amd motives in
particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confrented with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal bormeulation.

Value jocgerents about the culruiral significance of mass communication should be
saapended while audience orientations are explored om their own terms. (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumer, amd Gurevioch also commented that, although previews researches on
gratifiations detected diverse gratifications that attract people on the media, they did mot address the
connections between these grarifirations (Karz etal. 19748). They suggested that uses and gratifi-
cation research Goncern with following aspects: (1) the social and the peychobogical origins of (2)
needs which generate (3) expecations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) dif:
ferential expowore (or engaging in her activiries), resulting in (6) need gratification and (7) other
COnnQuences, perhaps mosiy unintended ones" (Katz etal. 14174b, p, 20). The spodies of Kare and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the wees amd grarificatians approach. Since
then, the research om this subject has been strengihened and extended. The current status of uses and
iratifications is stall based on Katz's first analysis, particulacly as pew media forms have emerged in
such an electrosée information age when people have more options of media use. j
