I, CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public, and the Tecssity af abtention-generating Propaganda in influencing
public opinion (Bernaye, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase,
the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more
than anything elae that distinguishes modern pulblic relations fram old-time hit or miss publicity and
propagatida (Bernays, 1955, p22). Furthermore, Hernays theories also represent a different view of
the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which
ea be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1028, p. 66), Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea
that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial [t must explain itself, its aims, ite objectives, to the
Public in terms which the public can understand and is willing te accept (p. 6).

Betnays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting ta
manipulate the public through propaganda, Hernays presents public relations as 4 tool that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objectivesminded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Hernays,
1952, p. 9). Bernaye view of the public is softer than that af Lippmann, a5 he recognizes the power of
anciety, but stall also claims that manipulation of the poblic is posable, Bernays (1062) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them.
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to peruade or cugmest courses of action [p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this polnt.
