that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership Mott i
made amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its alms, 11s objectives, to t
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 66). ;
Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a toal that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to rt (Bernays,
1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
society, but still aleo claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernaya (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade or suggest courses of action [p. 10), Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theartes developed by Lippmann, Losswell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number af
reagons. Based on the ideas af his predecessors, Lippmann was ale to bring attention to the fact that
the public ts able to be influenced by the media. The work of Lipprnann and kis colleagues has led to more
recent research that is meant te help understand the influence of the media on the public, Through the
work Iyengar and Kinder, White, Lewin, ond McCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensive understanding
of the media haa been developed, The public has now been trade aware vorious media functions such as

agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming, and the potential effects that these techniques can have on
their audiences,
