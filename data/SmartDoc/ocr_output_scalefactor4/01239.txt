1.1 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propagans :
PP n was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In

fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself
(Rogers, 1994), : : ;

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research, He focused on

conducting beth quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda,
and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswellis credited with creating
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis can be
defined as, "...the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message Content nto classifications
in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994), In an essay entitled "Contents of Communication,”
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persu ade the audience's opinion, and

the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content ol the message, Lasswell (1546) aims to

achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence that runs fram control te content and from content

to audience" (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, “Who says what in which ch annel ta whom and with what effects" (p. 44). Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the
remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion, This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited In the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it. however, I is still that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, amd is being presented to them by the government. This is a interesting way of Viewing

the power of the media (at is so newhat sumilar to Lippmanns teores

1.2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

Aut approximately the same time that Lippmann and | asswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bermays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays (1928)
defines propaganda as. a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of a
public to an enterprise, idea, or group (p. 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bemays recognizes
that propaganda can he either beneficial or harmful to the public. It can help individuals decide what to think
ahout or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be heneficial to society's functioning as 4 whole.
Bermays states, “We are powered, cut minis are ovolded, aur tastes formed, out ideas suggested, largely by
men we have never heard nf... ¥ast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live
