Uses and Gratifications

4.1 Introduction

ses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media research. The original
conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of
certain media contents. The core question af such research ig: Why do people use media
and what do they use them for? (McQ uail, 1983). There exists a basic idea in this approach:
audience members know media content, and which media they can use to meat their needs.
In the mass communication process, USES and gratifications approach puts the function of
linking need gratifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience members. It
suggests that people's needs influence what media they would choose, how they use cer-
tain media and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs fram other
theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users 45 opposed to
passive receivers of information. In contrast to traditional media effects theones which focus
on "what media do to people” and assume au diences are homage neous, uses and gratifica-
tions approach is more concerned with “what people do with media” (Katz, 1959). It allows
