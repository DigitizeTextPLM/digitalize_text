These preconditionsAdornos interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the
relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important to an understanding of

his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did mot bother to present iteelf as art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce

coercion ultimately meant the freedom to be the same {Horkheimer and Adorno, 2009. p. 136),

Since Adorno had been, in his essays on music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, The

Culture Industry has been criticized as being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture.

Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry [Horkheimer and
