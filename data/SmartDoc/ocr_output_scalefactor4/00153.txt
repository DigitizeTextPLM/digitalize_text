{e.2., sender-message-channel-recelver-effect, Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this $-M-C-R-E cONuMiu=
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(3) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variahle
is a very important factor, According to Rogers (1999), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process: (2

} innevativeness; (3) an innevation’s rate of wloption. Most innmo-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Difficcion research haw attempted to explain the variables

that influence how and wiy users and audience adopt.a mew information medium, such at the Jnternet.
According to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences ant important even though in thre
past the individual is usally the unit of analysis. Also, critical mass hecomes an impartial fact in
adopting new media because new media are interactive tools and thus are requined by many users fo
gain efficiency. That is, the more people use, the more people get benefits. Jn this sence, diffusion

cept him
there are five stages.

i. Knowledge + or - (selective exposure of awareness of news)

4. Attitudes + or — (people have positive or negative lee toward innovations)
3. Adoption (Decision): people decide to adopt the innovation
4. Implementation (regular or standard practice)

5, Confirmation (comparing and evaluating)
