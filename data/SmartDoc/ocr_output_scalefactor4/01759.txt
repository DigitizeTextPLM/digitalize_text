were published without their permission in 194%, Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing
themselves from their own work, in order not to jeopardize their return to acne In the late
1940s the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises in 1951. Horkheimer
hecame the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954 Adorno published an essay
entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of a study that had been done for the
Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner and others. In this essay Adorno
warned, rigid institationalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of unelreamed
of paychological control (Adorno, 2001a, p. 160). Te was one of the few occasions in the 195s
that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture. At Jeast one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments
of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adore would nonetheless on occasion attempt bo reshape
his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1949 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture
in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on The
Culture Industey Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the esay Transparencies on Film,
Adora conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 141).

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture

Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematle context, as opposed to
other writers in the Frankfurt School {Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 600). Instead of culture serving
iWeological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual inte mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. a3}. The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideclogy whose tialn objectives were to
maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that contral,

Exhoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions
(Marcuse, 1901, p. 8). However, it is difficult in Marcuses argument to separate culture
or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass
media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno
had done. In the end Marcuses analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant
ideology. Marcuse wrote, "how can the administered individualswho have made their mutilation
inte their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged scaleliberate

themselves from themselves as

wel] as from their masters? How is it even thinkable that the

vieious circle be broken? (Marcuse, 1991, p. 251}. Given the pessimistic bone of the book,
it jg somewhat ironic that largely because of it he would be perceived as an icon for leftist

movements of the 1960s in

the U.S. and Germany that developed an oppositional stance.

In spite of this, Marcuse maintained that he was & philosopher, and not an actlvist
eesti with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of the idea that theory could be translated

into practice (Chambers, 2004, p. 228).

work required too much re

vision to receive mass dissemination. The two authors continued to

negotiate with the Fischer publishing house until 1969, and may have only agreed to republish
the work since pirate copies had already been disseminated by individuals.
