According 10 Rogers (1306), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commnu-
gicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. Ag innovatken

sion of innovatioes involves bath mass media aed interpersonal communication channels” (p. ar.

There are five different types of adopters im the diffusion process, according bo bnnovativertss:

this term as “the degree to which an individual 1 relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
