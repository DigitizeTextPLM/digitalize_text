the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content i re eae

the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims Tt
achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence that runs from control to content and from content
to audience” (p. 74),

This methed of content analysis is tied strongly to Lagswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated. "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects” (p. &4). Content analysis was essen
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the
remainder ot his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive ta accept it. However, it is still that information that is attecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories

12 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays a Go|
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring eftort to create or shape events ta influence the relations of a
public to an enterprise, idea, or prowp (p. 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bemays recognizes
that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public. [t can help individuals decide what to think
about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to soctety’s functioning as a whole

Based om these ideas that the pu pic opinion can he modified, and that such shaping is a necessary part of
society, Bemays pursued his work in the field of public relations. "Public relations is the attempt, by info ti
