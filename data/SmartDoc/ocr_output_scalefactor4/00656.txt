Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that cam be
wed to combine the ideas of the public and the pereuader. The objective-minded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays,
lvoe, p. 3). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognises the power of
sonety, but still aleo claims that manipulation of the public ts possible. Gernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general public relations is important because it helpe then
