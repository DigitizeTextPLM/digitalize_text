1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion,
social influence, and small proup processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, bal-
ance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social aa heslant
played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such isteach eh er,
Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction,

Telational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars
as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut, During the later part of the decade
and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger became popular
along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson.
Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal comm research
agenda during the past two decades" (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus
on dyadic communication, communication invalwing face-to-face interaction, or communication as

a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically
focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. Tt has been recognized
that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975)
Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of stindy that has
contributed ta the development of the field of communication asa whole. This chapter strives to focus
on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in Communication. Their work
is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is conte
understanding of interpersonal processes.
