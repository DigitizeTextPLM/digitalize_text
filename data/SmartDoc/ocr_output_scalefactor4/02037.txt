departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jrgen Habermas woule haber tse, a
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the develapment of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe-
riences influencing the development of critical theory, the athers being Stalinist repression and the production
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48).

Agarne was at Oxford trom 1934 to 1938, where be worked on a manuscript on Husserl. He was considered
an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and be lovked forward to joining his Frank-
furt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime mowed bo the United States. Already in the late
1930s Adora evidenced little hope far mass culture, As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adomo debated mass culture, since film and radia became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships, The essay translated as “(in the Fetish
Character in Musle and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Ar in the Age of Mechanical Reprxduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adorno lay in the fact that instead ef being enjoyed ina concert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard ower the radia, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adomo was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adomo, 20016, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
ag the emancipation fram hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adora, the aura of ihe original amtwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity, To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
suthority of Platonic onder from the tep-the original or Idea- io down of layers of imitations; to Adamo, mass
production was oothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The gemeral attitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adora. In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in
Mew York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, run
