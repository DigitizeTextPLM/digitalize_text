1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the com cept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the dey elopment of communication the ory. Information exch inge 15 a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the roal of reducing uncertainty, Uneer-
faint) Reduction theory (CURT), accredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations Underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty (p. 133), The study of information is basic
to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the rele of communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories a starting points” (p. 94)
The research underlying the theon and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of inter
personal communication research; with the development of URT, communication researchers began to look to
communication for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social

1.2 The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Traditionally, communication has been viewed as an interdiscrplinary held. Interpersonal communication is
most often linked to studies into language, social cognition, and social psychology. Prior to the 1960s, only a
modest amount of research was completed under the label of interpersonal communication. Heath and Bryant
9000) marked this time as the origin of the field of interpersonal communication: “Particularly since 1960,
scholars adopted communication as the central term because they wanted fo study it as a significant and sila a
aspect of human behavior” (p. 49). The 1960s produced research that impacted the development of an in

terpersonal field. Research in psychiatry examined personality and the influence of relationships, finding that

psychiatric problems were not only a result of self problems, but a result of relational problems as well. Re-
