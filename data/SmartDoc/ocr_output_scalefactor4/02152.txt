Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1

UP. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among

the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well lncwn

and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher, He received his Ph.D. in Sa0-

clology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963 During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem, In the late 1960, Invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s to1990s (UPENN, 2001}, In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and alzo directed its
experimental Scholars program tor post-doctoral study.

Katz's mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, whois one of the pioneers of gratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theory model. Later, Katz intro duced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
notion that people use the media to their benefit. Ina shudy by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject
which is known as the uses and gratifications research were explored. They viewed the mass media as a means
by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and fou (hte: Ped[is bot the media to
their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitcn anc aes eet ae

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 which
were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication. They took a more humanist fe pproach to eatin at media
