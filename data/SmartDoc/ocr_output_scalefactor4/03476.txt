The book has become the standard textbook on diffusiom theory snd it crests applications of iffy
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, aa previcuially
mentioned, communication. Rogers retined from University of New Mexico in 2M because he was
suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005,

According to Rogers (196), difTusicn refers io “ihe peocess by which an innovation is commu-

nicated through certain channels aver time among the: members of a sockal syster. Aun Innevetion
ia an idea, practioe or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of edoption. The diffu-
sion of imervetions involves both mass media and interpersonal communicalioe channels” (p. 4094.
‘That ia, by sharing communication charmels such as inerperscnal communication of Mass Commas

There are five different types of adopters im the diffusion process, mocording 1 Inerecrvaverar es

jhis term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively eaclier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his snclal system” (Rogers, 1998, p. 40). Figure | shows the relaliceships bervean types
