I. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

: Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he bad seen in
Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative
in Europe. The closest thing in Adornos experience to the advertising industry in the United States
WHS fascist Propaganda (Diger, 2M, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience with
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the fesay on the culture industry by noting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, Pp. 87). Tt became obvious that Lazarafeld and Adama did
net agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adornos diseatiafaction with
the work of the Princeton Radin Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop
the idea of the culture industry.

Because of the relationship between the Institute
Horkheimer, who had alrendy moved fo Cal

for Social Research and Columbia Uninersitty,
tfornia, could not bring Adorno to the West Caaat until
i, When Adora was finally able to relocate, he joined on expatriate conuninity Hot
included Prits Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Bisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Dablin, and
Bertolt Brecht, seweral of which found work in the Hollywood movie industry. The fact that Adorno
was part of this intellectual community whose members were involved in the production of Hollywoud
movies must have had some influence in developing his thoughts on culture, since the Hollywood systern
inhibited the creative freedom that many af the erpatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany.

These preconditions Adornos interest in tousic, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the

relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important to an understanding of
his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Aderno, popular culture on film and radie did not bother te present itself as art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl,
1995, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adornowere the Hollywood production system, or
the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
2002, p. 99), Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p.
106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, and Adorno dited Oreon Welles
as an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity it the system would
allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it ite own, ultimately Tendering it ineffectual
(Friedman, 1981, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry Was atl instrument
of social control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedorn to chooge in a syebem of economic
coercion ultimately meant the freedom to be the same (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, PB 136).
Since Adore had been, in his easays on music and radio. aml apparent defender of high art, The
Culture Industry has been criticized as being a defense of high art, as opposed te popular culture.
Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkhemmer and
Adormo, 2002, p. 101). Tt was not high art that Adorno was presenting aS an alternative to the culture
industry, but modernism. Although he provides the idea of an opposing force to the culture Pai is!
