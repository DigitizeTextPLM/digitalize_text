I, RETURN TO GERMANY

1 Return to Germany

were published without their permission in 1949, Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing
themselves from their own work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the late
1940s the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises in 1951. Horkheimer
became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954 Adorno published an essay
entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of a study that had been done for the
Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner and others. In this essay Adorno
warned, rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed
of psychological control (Adorno, 2001a, p. 160), It was one of the few occasions in the 1951s
that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments
of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape
his thought on the culture industry, For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture
in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21}, and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film,
Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 131).

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, a5 opposed to
other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p- 609). Instead of culture serving:
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p- 144), Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society gatishied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, P. a3). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideclogy whose maitt objectives were to
maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.
Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions
(Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, it is difficult. in Marcuses argument to separate culture
or mass media from society a3 4 whole because Marcuse did nat distinguish culture or mass
media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology im the same Way that Adorno
had done. In the end Marcuses analysis of society allowed for ne opposition to the aa
‘deology. Marcuse wrote, "how can the administered individualswho have made epee ; tion
inte their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an ark a ca
themselves from themselves as well as from their masters? How is it even thin eee ; nn
