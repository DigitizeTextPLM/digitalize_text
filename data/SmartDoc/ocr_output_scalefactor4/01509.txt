{. CRITICAL RESPONSE TO “THE CULTURE INDUSTRY"

He complained to the dean about the radical students in his classes pats a Toe
teaching impossible, In the winter term of 1968-69 students occupied anum oO pearl
at the University at Frankfurt, including the Institute for Social Research. After @ ra
ended, Adorno returned to teaching, but his lectures continued to be disrupted, including

one “tasteless demonstration’ in which three females bared their breasts. Adorno died a few
months later (Jager, 2004, p. 201-08).

1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culture industry outside of a German context. In the years since there have been numer-
ous criticisms of the text, not least since Adomoa made sweeping generalizations about "the
commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adore erred in not discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, be-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an allepervasive reification” {Eagleton
1991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
amang Oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the Sys-
tem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adorno’s idea

of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the 1960s
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural

Possibilities available during the 1940s.
While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial soci
eties between 1920 and 1970, trying to

use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hahendahl
1995, p, 146-48)

Thus, for a some crities, the value of the idea of the cull
appear to be merely historical, if ney in fact conceded

Thies for sone critics modernist works would be cou
Meclogy, As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case that the
dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of the culture
industry has had an importance in critital theary since its aPPEarance in the 1440s, in that
it has led to thought about the Pole of mass communications in relation
