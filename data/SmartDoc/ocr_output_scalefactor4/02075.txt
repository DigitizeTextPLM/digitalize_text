rah Cook. Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on see
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 45)
For Jerry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, be-
lieving that capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton,
4991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the raproduction of the sys-
tem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36). Fredric Jameson painted out that Adarnos idea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in tne 1960s
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1940s.
While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial ocr
eties between 1920 and 4970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl,
4995, p. 146-48). Thus, for a some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry would
appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value at all.

Thus for some critics modernist works would be cou nteracting forces against the dominant
ideology. As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case that the
dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of the culture
industry has had an importance in critical theory since Its appearance in the 1940s, in that
it has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation to ideology, and
hence, society. Since Adora made sweeping generalizations about the impact of the culltire
industry, and since he did not systematically explore how the culture industry operated, ithas
been generally easy for some to dismiss the idea of a culture industry. It Is nonetheless the
