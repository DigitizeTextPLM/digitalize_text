Five hasic assumptions were stated in a study of Karz, Bluenler, and Gureviteh in 1974 as follows.
They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media and audiences:

1. The audience is conceived a6 ective, Le. an impoctant pan of of mass media ase is
asumned to be goal oriented ... pamemns of media use are shaped by mone or less
definite expectations af what certain kinds of coment have to offer the audience
member.

2. Inthe mass communication process much initiative in linking need gratification amd
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong Limitation on
theotizing abour amy form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and
behavior

4. The media compete with other sources of peed sarisfacton, The needs served by

and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consump
Non certainly varies,

from data supplied by individual andience members themselves- ie, people

connections between these gracifications (Katz et al, 19743). They suggested thar uses and gratifi-
