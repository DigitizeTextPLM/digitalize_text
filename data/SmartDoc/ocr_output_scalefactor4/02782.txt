1 Early Influences

The fallewing theorists significantly contribyted to the ecamination of uncertainty in communication.
The influence of their work can be seen reflected im ihe assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1) Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology atthe Universicy of lown under the direction af Runt Lewin. Lewin,
ome ofthe founders of social paychology and a pioseer in the research of group dynamics, had a sub-
stantial mfluence on the developenens of interpersoeal communication. After graduadion, imitially
worked at the University of Rochester, but in 145 he followed Lewin to Maxsachesetts Insti-
tute of Technology and the Research ter Cor Croup Dynamics. Atter Lewin death. Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Seanford University, and the Mew School for Social Research
{Samelson, SHH). Mach of Pestinger’s research fedlowed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging [iebd of in-
fterpersonal communication and on the development of UBT. Festinger is best Rec fer the thecrecs
of Cognitive Dissonance and Soctall C arison., Cogmilinar 7 (LOT) attempend to
explain how an imbalance among cognilions moght affect an individual, Lewin foreshadowed COT
in bis observations repanding amitude change in small groups (Pestinger, [982). COT allows for three
reliticeships to Occur amor cognitions: a consonant relationshap, im which Gognilkims are in eyai-
libriam wath each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cogmations are is competition wath each
other: and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have mo effect om one anciher
(Wiest & Turner, 21NMi). Cognitive Dessonance, like uncertamé(y, has an clement of arousal and dis-
conmfort that individuals seck to redece, Soctal Comparises theory postulates that individuals look oo

their behavior and/or opinions in a partioslar siluation™ (p, (OT). Festinger received the Distmpuished
Scientiet award of the areca Payckokogical A on and the Distingsished Senior Scheatist

his theoretical influence can ailld be recognized in contemporary social science research, Aronson tin
