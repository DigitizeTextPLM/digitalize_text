According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is c
nicated through certain chann

els over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
ferceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
ston of Innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409),

That is, by sharing communication channels such as intet personal communication or mass commu-
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed ag five parts, S-M-C-R-E
(@.2., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this $-M-C-R-E comm¢|mu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p- 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(9) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variable
is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process: (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Ovffiuston research has ofenpted fo explain the variables

According to evolution af media technolagy, interpersonal influences are important even though in the
past fhe individual is usually the unit of analysis. Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in
adopting few media becaise Rew Aredia are interactive fools and thus are required by many wsers to

theary nor only can apply te practical things, but alsa can be related to digital divide.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
*(1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) aggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 1835-185). Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting mew ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure | shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories
follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped, Source by www2.gsu.eduwwwitrdocs/dif-

a S-shaped curve, However, as noted above, different types of innovations (¢.g., the rate of tetracycline
