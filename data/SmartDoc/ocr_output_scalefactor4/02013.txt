Uses and Gratifications |

4.1 Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach ig an influential tradition in media rasearch. The original
conception of the approach Was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of
certain media contents. The core question of such research is: Why do people use media
and what do they Use therm for? (MeQuail, 1983) There axists a basic idea in this approach:
audience members know media content, and which media they can Use ta meet their needs.
In the mass communication process, USGS and gratificatans approach puts the function of
linking need gratifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience members. it
suggests that people's needs influence what media they Wwe uld choose, how they use car
tain media and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs from ather
theareiical perspectives in that it regards audiences a5 active media users a5 oppased to

] passive receivers of information. in contrast to traditional media effects theories which focus
| on “what media do to people” and assume audiences are homogeneous, uses and gralifca-

tions approach is more concerned with “what peop de with media® (Katz, 195%), It allows
audiences personal needs ta use media and responds to the media, which determined by
their social and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates
that the media compere with other information sources for audience's need satisfaction (Katz
et al, 1974a), As traditional mass media and new media continue to provide peaple with a
| wide range aft media plalforms and content, it is considered one of the most apprapnate
] perspechves for Investigating why audiences choose to be exposed to different.
] The approach emphasizes audiences’ choice by aesessing their reasons for using
] a certain media to the disregard of others, a5 wellas the various gratifications obtained
| fram the media, based on individual social and psychological requirements (Severin
& Tankard, 1997). As 2 broader perspective among communication researches, it pro-
vides 4 framework for understanding the processes Dy which media participants seak
Infanmation or content selectively, commmonsurate Why their needs and interests (Katz
| et al, 1974a}. Audience members then incerporate the content fe fulfill their needs oF
] te satisfy their interests (Lowery & Nabila, 1983).
