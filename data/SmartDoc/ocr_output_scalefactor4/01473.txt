Aside from understanding the content of prapaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how peopapa
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media, eee serie
interested in examining she effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cyele, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still chat information that is albecting thelr decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmarin’s theories.

12 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bermays (18891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays (1928)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events ta influence the relations of a
public to an enterprise, ides, of group (p. 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bemays recognines
that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful two the public, It can help individuals dechde what to think
about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to society's fanctinning as a whale.
Bemays states, “We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by
men we have never heard of... Vast numbers af human beings must cooperate in this manner if chev are to Live
topether as a smoothly functioning society (p. 3). ee ae
: Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be modified, and that such shaping is a necessary part of
society, Bernays pursued his work in the field of public relations. "Public relations is the antempt, by informaxicn,
