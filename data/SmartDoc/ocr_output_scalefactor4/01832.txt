research and the development of communication theary. Information exchange is a basic human function in

reducing uncertainty wat a central motive of communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One ofthe motivations underpinning interpersonal communication

to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field af interpersonal communication URT places the role of communicwtion into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
shrese (1973) nate: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories as starting points” fp. 99),
The research underlying the theary and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of inter-
personal communication research; wiih the development of WRT, communication researchers began to look ta

communication for theorics of preater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social
sciences,
