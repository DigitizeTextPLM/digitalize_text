relaional development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars
as Knapp, Mebrabiam, Aliman, Taylor, Dnack, Belley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the decade
and into che 19606, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Rolati, and Berger became popular
along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation oy Giles, Baurgoon, and Patterson.
Berger (20005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersoeal comm research
agenda during the past two decades" (p. 416). Today, interpersonal commuanicabon lends to focus

a function of developing relationships. Research inte interpersonal communication theory typically
fecuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been rerognazed
that interpersonal communication is motivated by umcerainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identifed as am important construct, necessary to the shady of comm:
fication, i would be beneficial to know when the concept originaled, and how it has been defined
and studied. One way co consider unceralnry is through the theoretical framesock of information
theory, Shannon and Weawer (1949) proposed that uncertainty exisned ina given sinuation when there
wat a high amount of possible ahernatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this view of amcertainny fo ihe transmission af messages, bur their work
also contributed to the development of WRT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts froen the
information theorists as well as Heider (1958) research im antribution. Berger and Calabrese (LTS)
expanded the concept of uncertainty co fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as
the “number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p10). The greater the
level of uncertainty that exists in a situarkon, the smaller the chance indivicuals will be able io pre

predicting present and past behaviors, bet also explaining why partners behave or believe tei the way
that they da. Berger and Bradac’s (1982) detinition of uncenaincy highlighted the complexity of this
