1 Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication,
The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1974),

1.1) Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of lowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin, Lewin,
one ofthe founders of social psychology and a pioneer im the research of group dynamics, bad a sub-
stantial influence on the development of interpersonal comenunicanon, After graduacion, initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts linsani-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dymambes, After Lewin death, Festinger
worked al the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the Mew School for Social Research
(Samelson, DMM). Much of Festinger’s research followed bis mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin's theones. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging fetd af in-
terpersomal communication and on the developoent of UT, Festeger is best knows for ihe theories
of Cognstive Dissonance and Sorel Clomquirisor, Coggriative Dissonance theory (COT) attempted Ti]
explain hee an imbalance among eognitioes might affect an individual. Lewin forestadowed C11
in his ohservations regarding attinide change in small growps (Festinger, 19K2) COT allows for three
relationships Lo oocur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equi-
librium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each
other: and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one anther
(West & Tumer, 2000) Cogeitive Dissonance, like uncerainty, has an clement of arousal and dis-
comfort that individuals seek to redece, Sock Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to
feedback from ofhers to evaluate their performance and abilities. To cvaluate the self, the individual
sully seeks the opinions of others who are sinsilar to the self, This meed for social comparison can
result im aanbonmity pressures {Trenholm & Jensen, 2004). Berger and Calabrese (1975) related s-
cial comparison to URT by stating that “Festinger has suggesied that persons seek out ae
whe are proximate wiren Urey experience a high level of uncertainty Fegardang thee appropriateness
thelr behavior andtor opinions in & partioular situation” 1p 107). Festinger reserved the oe
Scientist wward of the American Psychokigical Asurciacion and the Dnistinguiebed aol —gor
dyward from Uhre Society of Experimental Social Paychology. Festinger’ kegacy is Significant, .
his theoretical influence car still be recognized in conlemporary soc ial spheres de eer :
Pestinger, 1960) stated, “I vers in this era that Leon Festinger invested and developed his theory a

cogaltive dissonance, and in my opinion, social psychology has not heen ihe same since” (jp. 3)
