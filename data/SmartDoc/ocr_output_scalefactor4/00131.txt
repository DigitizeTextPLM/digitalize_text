1 Defining Uncertainty

Sinde uncertainty has been identified as am important comstnoct, necessary to the study of comenu-

fication, if woakl be beneficial io Know when ihe concept originated. and bow it has been defined
amd studied. Cine way co consider uncertainry is though the theoretical framework of informarion
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed ina given situation when there
wai a high amount of possible allematives and the probability of thei event was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uinertaininy yo the Tansmissiom of metesages, but their work
also connttuted to the developmen of LRT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopred concepes from the
information theorists as well as Heider (1954) research im atiribuiton. Berger and Calabeese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty (0 Gl intenpersonal communication by defining unceriainty as
the “number of atemalive ways in which each imerectant might behave" (p, LOO). The greater the
level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able ta pee-
diet behaviors and occurences. Goring interactions individuals are not only faced with problems of
predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or believe jin the way
that they da, Berger and Bradac's (1982) definition of unceriainty highlighted ihe complesiny of this
process when they stated: “Uncertainty, then, can stem from the lange number of aiemarive things
that 4 siranper cari believe or potentially say" Unoertainty plays a significam role when on
relacionships. High bevels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational developenem. Ling

actions individuals are expected to increase predictability with the goal that chis willl lead to the ability

and predictability cam deaden a relationship,
