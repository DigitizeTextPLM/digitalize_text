Rogers was bom in Carroll, lowa in 1931, He eamed his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from lowa
State University, For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly,

in 1966, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea.

The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creats applications of diffu-
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously
mentioned, communication, Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was

suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005.

According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu-
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
1s an idea, practice or abject perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).
That is, by sharing communication channels such a5 interpersonal communication of mass commu

nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell

(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, §-M-C-R-E

(e.2. sender-message-channel-receiver-effect), Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this S-M-C-R-E commu-

model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can he a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, “Time” variable
is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time varinble is involved in diffusion in (1)

the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativencss; (3) an innowation’s rate of adoption, Most inno-

vations have an $-shaped rate of adoption. Diffiasion research hat attempted to explain the vanities

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innevativeness:
“(1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters {respectable}, (3) Early Majority (Deliberate). ea
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Lageards ftraditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-183). Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual 13 relatively earlier in adopting mew ideas than other

members of his social system” (Rogers, 1994, p. 40). Figure | shows the relationships between types
