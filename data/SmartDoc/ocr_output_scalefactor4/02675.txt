1. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialtzation of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in

Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the Uni

in Europe. The closest thing in Adornos : SIRE aly Hi os alo

was fascist propaganda (Jager, 2004, p. 122}. Adarno was later to ituaa ts his experience with

division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research az being indistinguishable from polities!
propaganda (Horkheimner and Aderna, S02, p97). Tt became obvious that Lazarefeld and Adorno did
Hot agrec on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno lett the project. Adarnos dissatisfaction with
the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop
the idea of the culture industry.

November 1341, When Adorna was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate community that
included Frits Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hane Eisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Dablin, and

These preconditions Adornos interest in music, bis friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the
Telationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important to an understanding of
his conoem for the idea of the culture industry,

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, papular culture om film and radia did not bother to present itselfas art, They were lnetead
a business, and this in turn ieecame an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkhelmer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This busines: was based on what Adorno referred to as Pordist
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy {Hohendahl,
1995, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adormowere the Hollywood production system, or
the CES radio network that had been assoclated with the Princeton Racio Hesearch Project. Mavies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work [Horkheimer and Adora,
2002, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system,
and that nothing traly adversarial te the syatem would emerge (Herkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p
106-7}. Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, and Adamo cited Orson Welles
as an example of someone wh was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would
allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual
(Friedman, M81, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was ao instrument
of social control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of economic
eoercion ultimately meant the freedom to be the same [Horkheimer and Adarna, 2002, p. 136).

Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and
