1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic assumptions were staged in a

study of Katz, Blamler,
They provide a framework for undetstandi er, and Garevitch in 1974 as follows,

ng the correlation between media and sadbences:

1. The auchence 6 conceived as active, 10... af important part of of mass media use i
assumed to be goal oriented ... patterns Of media use are shaped by more on less

definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience
fétniber.

2, Inthe cass communication process much indtiative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member, This places & strong Limitation an

theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and
behavier.

4. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
Tass OOnGunication conmstinne but a segment of the wider range of human needs,

and the degree to which they can be adequarely met through mass media consump-
Thon certainly waries.

4. Methodolegically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use cam be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- Le, peaple
are sufficiently self-aware to be able po report their interests and motives in

particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with thea inan = ie |

§. Value judgments about the culvaral significamce of mass communication should be a

suspended while audience orientations ane explored om their own berms. (pe 15-17)

In aekKlition, Katz, Plumber, and Garevitch also comenented that, although previous researches on
gralifications detected diverse gratificarecnes that attract peaple on the media, they did mot address the
commections between these gracifications (Katz ef al, 1974a) They suggested thar ists and pratifi- !

ferential expasune (or engaging in other activities), revakting ih (5) need pratification aed (7) other
consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones” (Katt ot al. 15974b, p. 20) The studies af Kare and
his colleagues laid a theceetical foundation of butkdling the uses and gratification: approach Since
ihen, the research on this subject has been serengthened and extended. The current stanis cof uses and
gracifications is still based on Kate's first analysis, particularly as ew media formes have emerged in
mech an electronic information age when people have sore options of aredla use.
