1.1 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

Harold Lasswell (1902-1979) was a peominent scholar in the ares of propaganda research. He focused an

conducting both quantitative anc qualitative analyses of propaganda, und J :
nda onthe mass audience (Rogers, 1954). Lasawell is credited with creating

defined as, °-..he investigation of cammvanication messages by cabegorizing

its order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1954). In an essay entitled :
Lasswell (L546) explains that a conbent analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain.

symbals appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade tse audience's opinion, ane
the intensity of the symbols wied. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream af influence thar cans from control to content and fram combest
ta audience" (p. 74).

This method of conbent analysis is tied strangly to Lasswell (1953) early definidon of communication which
stated, “Who says what in which channel tn wham are with what effects” [p. BA). (Conbent analysis was ¢s260-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on todo a lot of work within this area during the

remainder af his career.
‘Aside fram understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could

shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media, Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. [n this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public limited in the information that is presented to them,
and alse apprehensive ta accept it. However, it is still that information that is affecting their decisions within
the demacratic system, and is being presented to them by the government, This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theartes.

1.2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propagansla,
Edward Bermays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, peapaganda, and public opinion, Bernays (1928)
wee propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of a
public to an enterprise, idea, or group (p, 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bermays Tecognines
that propaganda can be either beneficial ot harmful to the public, [t can help individuals decide what to think
about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to socieny’s functioning a4 4 whole
Bermays states, “We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suppested, largel hy

Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be modified, amd that ing i BCeSSary
