fates nc im 1949, Hockheinver and Adorn protested, distancing
1 er mot to feopardize their return ta Germany. In the late
1940s the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises in 1951. Horkheimer
became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954 Adorna published an essay
entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of a study that had been done for the
Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner and others. In this essay Adorno
warned, rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed
of psychological control (Adorno, 200La, p. 160). It was one of the few aceasions in the 195s
that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture, At least one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments
of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt ta reshape
his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture
in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 196% on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered, In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film,
Adore conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 131).

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to
other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 600). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Heitz, 2000, p. 144), Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose Main objectives were to
maintain social contro] and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.
Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated fromm their manipulation and indoctrination functions
(Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, it is difficult in Marcuses argument to separate culture
or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass
media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno
had done, In the end Marcuses analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant
ideology, Marcuse wrote, "how can the administered individualswho have made their mutilation
into their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged scaleliberate
thernselves frorn themselves as well as from their masters? How is it even thinkable that the
vicious circle be broken? (Marcuse, 1991, p. 251). Given the pessimistic tone of the book,
it ig somewhat ironic that largely because of it he would be perceived as an icon for leftist
movements of the 1960s in the U.5. and Germany that developed an oppositional Stance.
In spite of this, Marcuse maintained that he was a philosopher, and not an activist. Like others
sccoviated with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of the idea that theory could be translated

i bar he Loan 1GBL, FHiedsich Pollack reported ta Adorno and Horkhetmer that the
work required too much revision to receive mass dissemination. The two authors continued to
negotiate with the Fischer publishing house until 1969, and may have only agreed to republish
the work since pirate copies had already been disseminated by individuals.
