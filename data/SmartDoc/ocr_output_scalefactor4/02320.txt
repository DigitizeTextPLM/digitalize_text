Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on
conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the contens of propaganda,
and discovering the effect of propaganda an the mass audience (Rogers, 1994}, Lasswell is credited with creating
the mass communication procedure of comene analysis (Rogers, 1994), Generally, content analysis can be
defined as, *...che investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classifications
in exder to Measure certain variables* (Rogers, 1994), In an essay endithed "Comveni of Communication,"
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinbon, amd.
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the cantent of the message, Lasswell (1546) aima t
achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence that runs fram contral to content and from content
to audience” (p. 74),

This method of content analysis is tied strongly 10 Lasswell (1959) early definition of communication which
stated, “Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" (p. 94). Content analysis was essen-
tally the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of wark within this area during the
remainder af his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in haw propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media, Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created 4 cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to anceps it, However, it ts sill that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, amd is being presented co chem by the govercnvenct. This is an inperesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories

12 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays (1928)
defines propaganda as, 4 consistent, enduring effort to creave of shape events to influence the relations of a
public te an enterprise, idea, or group (p. 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Berays recognlaes
that propaganda can be elther beneficial or harmful co the publkc. [t can help individuals decide what te think
about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to sockety’s functioning as a whole.
Bemays states, “We are governed, our minds are molded, aur tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by
men we have never heard of... Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner Lf they are to live
together as asmowhly functioning society [p. 9). ae
Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be modified, and that such shaping is a necessary part of
society, Bemayss pursued his work in the field of public relations, “Public relations ls the altempt, by information,
persuasion, and adjustment, t engineer public support for an activity, cause, movement, of institution’ (Bernays,
1955, p. 3). Inthe Engineering of Consent, Bernays (1955) lays aut che framework for understanding the public
and developing a public relations campaign. Bernays (1955) claims that the key to a successful public relarhons
campaign is adjustment of the campaign to the attioudles of varlous Broups in society, gathering information
to effectively express an idea, and finally, utilizing persuaslon to influence the public opinion im the imended

direction.
Bernays’ theories

represent a step forward for mass communication theory. They move away from more
typical presentations of “hit-or-miss propaganda,” and move toward a deeper
