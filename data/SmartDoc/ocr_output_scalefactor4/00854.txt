The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of ne ee (1975),
The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of Lowa under the direction of Kurt epee

one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, mu

stantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, initially

worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Insti-

tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin death, Festinger

worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research

(Samelson, 2MMH), Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed

Lewin’s theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging fteld of in-

terpersonal communication and on the development of URT, Festinger ts best known for the theories

of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted to

explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed CDT

in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982), CDT allows for three

relationships te occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equi-

librium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each

other; and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another

(West & Tumer, 2000). Copnitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an clement of arousal and dis-

comfort that individuals seck to reduce, Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to

feedback from others to ewaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual

usually secks the opinions of others who are similar to the self. This need for social comparison can

result in conformity pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, 2004). Berger and Calabrese (1973) related so-

cial comparison to URT by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons seek out similar others
who are proximate when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness af
their behavior and/or opinions ina particular situation” (p, 107), Festinger received the Distinguished
Scientist award of the American Poychological Association and the Distinguished Senior Scientist
Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psycholowy. Festinger's legacy is significant, and
his theoretical influence can still be recognized im contemporary social science research. Aronson a
Festinger, 1980) stated, “It was iti this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of
cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, sovial psychology has not been the same since” ip. 3).

12 Fritz Heider (1896-1988)
Pritt Heider earned fis doctorate in philesophy thom the University of Graz. Davi : “

Evrape, Heider worked With mary renowned pavchologists such as Wolfrang Kohler pi Pana
aid Kart Lewin. Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin as a substantial impact on his life: “I earn
to pay tribute to Lewin stimulating influence, which has affected much of my thinking een

still strong even in this book, although it does not derive directly from his work" (Heider, 1958 z
vil). In 1929, Heider moved to the United States ta work at Smith College and later the U. i ee
Kansas where he worked for the remainder of his life CAsh, 20M. babi
