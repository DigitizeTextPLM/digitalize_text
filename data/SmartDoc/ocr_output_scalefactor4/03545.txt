He complained ta the dean about the radical students in his classes who ware making

at the Liniversity at Frankfurt, including the institute for ‘Social Research. Amer the sbrike

4 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the Kea of the
culture industry quisde of a German comiext. In the years sinse there have boen nuner-
ous criliciems of the text, not least since Adora made weeding generalizations about “the
commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1986, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cock, Adore erred in nod discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and failed ta examine: the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including maricating and advertising (Cock, 1966, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Aderna and Marcuse cvarestimated the dominant idealogy, be-
liewig that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton,
1501, p. 46). Stil, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusean af dominant values ard beliefs
among oppressed peapies in saciety has some part Io play in the reproduction of the sys-
tam as a whole” (Eagleton, 1981, p. 28). Frednc Jameson pointed out that Adome's dea
af a culture industry was historically irnited, since the society that developed in the 19605
and 1970s with new media went beyord the cultural possibilities available during the 1944s.
While the idea of the culure mdusiry can be defended a6 @ usetul theory for industrial soci-
elies bebween 1820 and 1970, Irving to use it today weakens ils effectiveness (Hohendahil,
1996, p. 146-48). Thus, for a some critics, tne value of the idea of the cullune industry would
appear ip be merely historical, if they in fact comeeded thal it had any vahi at all.

Thus for some orifice modemist works wouk) De counteracting forces agains! the dominant
ideology. As noted in the example of Orgon Vvelles, however, Aimay be the case that the
dominant ideology can co-opt modennist works for its own ends. The idea of the culture
induatry has had am inportance in critical Theory since fis appearance in the 1940s, in that
it has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relaion to declogy, and
hence, society. Since Adorno made aweaping generalizations about the impact of the culture
industry, and since he did not systematically explore how the curure industry operated, it has
been generally easy for some bo demise the idea of a culbure industry. | is ronetheless ihe
ease that motion pictures are still made by large companies and that their mowers langety rely
on ieemulaic plats. tis alee the cade that radio ip increasingly controlled by a small number
af companies, which tend to impose resifiefions on how stations operate. As a broadcast
medium, television it very much related to both radio and film, ard shares with them qualiiies
that situation fin the culture industry. While there is a democralizing aspect to the levigareet
{in thal anyone can oreabe a web site), it happens thal the commercial Companies operating
on the Internet continue to maintain an declogical function. For example, one seldom see5
pew siccies on MSNBC or Yahoo thal woukl question the prerogatives of corporate Arrugiriical.
4 reexamination of the idea of the comune industry may be necessary in order to iheorine on
how mass communication mecka propagale dominart ieologies.
