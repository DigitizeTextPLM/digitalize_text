A language |e therefore, -a social institution and 4 system of values. itis the social part af
language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one
wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that
rasists the modifications coming from @ single indivichual and is consequently a social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view fo expressing his personal thought. It is because epaech is
essentially a combinative activity that i corresponds to and individual act and not to a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1987, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausume distinguishes the language system into two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which ig expressed through the form,
The fern is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the external forms axpressing the actual animal dog. Here. the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. “| propose to retain the word sign (sign) ta
designate the whole and to replace concept and gound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them fram each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis
fed.), p. 37). The correspondence of the conceptimeaning to the external form is mot in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbarary relation. tt is not the inevitable intemal relation but the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that “language does
not reflect a pre-existent and extemal reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from
within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic diffarances”. According to Saussure, “meaning
is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic
(6.9. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (@.9., synonyms), organized into a signifying system” (Barker,
2002, p. 29). As 4 grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. Foran example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the fallow-
ing sentence: “tl went to a theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence is established through the
linear combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as | theater, my, and girlfriend can be
substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as “She wentto a restaurant with her mother."
Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated only when
they are related to each other, "Crucially, signs do not make sense by virtue of reference inentilies!
