i. NEEOG AND GRATIFICATION

1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratitications aparaach emphasimes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience mern-
bers. Blumier and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the sane communication mes-
sage for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs far diferent
indwiduals. There is net only ore way that people uses media. Contrarily, there are 25 many reasons
for using the media as there are media users (Blumer & Katz, 1374].

Basic needs, socal situation, and the individual's background, such a6 experiance, interests, and
education, atfect peogle's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet ther
needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratificatians
for using different media. MoQuadl, Blumer, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person
inherachions” to classity four important media gratifications: [1] Diversion: escape fromm routine or
problema; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social ublity; (3) Personal

identity: elf reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance (farms of informg-
fon seeking.

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by MoGuire (1974), based
on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensices: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus
“mternal” goal orientation, and emotion stability af “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
These Tattors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply te media use (Figure 2). Fagure 1. A
