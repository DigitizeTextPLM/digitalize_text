LL) Haredd Lasewell (1902-1978)

AAs Lipprane was willing propaganda, ‘Haredd Lasewell wis uraleruking empitical analyses of propaganda. In
fact, much of the propaganda that Lasewell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himselt
(Regers, 19%).

Harold Lanawell (102-1978) was a promineet scholar in the area of propaganda research. He doceued on
conducting both quantitatiee and quadicative analyses of propaganda, undeestandieg the content of propaganda,
and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass wedience (Rogers, (ise. Lasewell is crediued with creating,
the mast communication procedore of comeent analysis (Rogers, EM), Generally, content analysis can be
defined as," _the inemtigetion of communication messages by cave geriting meee canmem iin claudication’
in onder in micarore certain varlabdes” (Reger, 1904). In an ey eniiiled “Contents. od Commrenication,”
Lacrerell (146) explains that a concent analysis shold take into account the Irequency with whech cerain
symbols appear im a message, the direction in which the syribals try to prerouaedir che audharbe"s opmion, and
the ieweralcy of ihe symbols used, By understanding the coment of the Mmessagt. ‘Lasewell (15465) aim 10
achieve the goal of uederiaanding the “wean of influence that cuss from. control in cement al from conlent

At appromcimantely the same time that Lippman and Lasawell were examining public opinion and peupaqanda,

Exbward Bemays (L31- L056) was examining public rebriiens, propaganda, and public opmian. Bemays (1528)
