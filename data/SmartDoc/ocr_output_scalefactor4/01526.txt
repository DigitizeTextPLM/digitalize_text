that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can De
made amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its obpecti
public in terms which the public can understand and 1s willing to accept [p. GO).
Bernave elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public re lations as a tool that can he
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective minded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helpe the public adjust to it (Bernays,
1952, p. #). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippriann, as he recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade or suggest courses of action [p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it is not in euch blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.
