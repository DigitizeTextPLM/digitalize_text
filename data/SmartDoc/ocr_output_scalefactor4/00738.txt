: explains that a content analysis should take inte account the frequency with which cemain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the auclience's opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) alms to
achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence that runs from cantrol ta comtens and from coment
to audience’ (p, Py.

This method of content analysis is tied strongly io Lasswell (1953) early definition of commvunbcation whic
stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects” (p. 4), Content analysis was essen-
ally the says what part of this definition, and Laswell went on to do a lot of work within this area ducing the
Temainder of his career

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasewell was also imerested in how propaganda could
shape public opinton. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects af the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within 4 democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and alse apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of che media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann's thearies.

1.2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public piel as
