1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the title af interpersonal commumication initially focused on persuasion,
social influence, and small graup processes Theories explored the role of learning. dissonance, hal-
ance, social judgment, and reactance (Benger, 2005). Kurt Lewis, a forefather of social psychology,
played a considerable rale in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider,
Kelley, and Hovland, By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction,
relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars
is Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, amd Thibaut. During the later part of the decade
and inte the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Rolotl, and Berger became popular
along with research into behavioral amd commrunbcative adapiation by Giles, Burgoon, and Paterson.
Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal comm research

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since unceriaanty has been identified as am ifapartant construct, necesiary to the spudy of comnen-
nicaGon, i would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined
and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1447) proposed that uncertainty evasied ina given siniation when there
