4 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culture indusing outside of a Gennan context. In the years since Gere awe basen murat
cus criticanns of the text, nod least since Adore made sweeper generalizations about “the
commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1696, po 113). For the
generally aymeathatic Deborah Cook, Adamo erred in mot discussing the processes af cut
tural production, ard failed 1 examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business sectars, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1986, p. 441).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adarna ard ott
lieving that “capitals! society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasier revhoabon (Eagiatan,
1991, p. 46) Shll, Eagleton comoaded that “the diffuseon of dominant values ard beliele
amang oppressed peoples in society Nas some pari io play in the reproduction of the ays-
jem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1997, 9 36), Fredric Jameton poinied oul that Adonno's idea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society Mat developed in the 13606
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cuitural possibiiies available during the 12406.
White the idea of the culture industry Gan be defended a6 a useful theary for industrial soci
phen between 1920 and 1970, prying bo use & today weakens ite eHeclivencss (Hohendahl,
4996, p 146-48). Thus. fora some onties, the value of the dea of the culture industry waukd
aopear to be merely historical, if they in fact comoeded that it had any value at all

Thus for same otitics modernist works would be counteracting forces againe the dominant
ideclogy. AS noted in the axample of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case that the
dominant Weclogy can co-op modernist works for iis cwn ends. The dea of the cufure
industry hes had an importance in critical iheary sce its appearance in the 1408, in that
it has led fo thought about the role of mass communications in relation to idealogy, and
hence, soaety Since Adorna made sweeprig generalizations about the impact of the culture
industry, ard since he did not syslematically explore haw ihe cuture mdusiry operabed, it has
been generally easy tor some to dismiss the Kea ala cultura industry. His nonetheless ihe
case that motion pictures are still made by large companies and that their movies largely rely
on foemulaic: plata. itis alee the case that rage is increasingly contralled by a small number
of companies, which tend to impose resinchons on how lations operale. As @ oroadcast
medium, television is. very much related te both radio and film, and shares with them qualities
that situation ft in the cullute industry. While here is a democratizing aspect to the Iritermat
(in that anyone can create a web site), it happens that the commercial companies operating
on the Internet continue to maintain an ideological function, For example, one sekiom sees

how mass communication media propagate dominant ideologies.
