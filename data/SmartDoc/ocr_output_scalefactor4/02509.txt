i : i analysis (Rogers, 1994), Generally, content analysis can be
soa as, "...the investigation of communication messages hy categorizing message content into classifications
= a (0 Measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994), In an essay entitled “Contents of Communic ation,”
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Laswell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that runs from control to content and from content
to audience” (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, “Who says what in which channel ta whom and with what effeers" in. 84), Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the
remainder of his career

Asie from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion, This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing

the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories

L2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bermays (1928)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of a
public to an enterprise, idea, or group (p. 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bermays retogniees
that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public. It can help individuals decide what to think
about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to society's functioning as a whole.
Bernays states, “We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas sugpested, largely by
men wae have never heard of,,. Vast numbers of human beings Must cooperate in this manner if they are to live
together as a smoothly functioning society (p. 9). _ aie

Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be moxdlified, and that such shaping is a necessary part oft
society, Bermays pursued his work in the field of public relations. “Public relations is the attempt, by ect te tl
