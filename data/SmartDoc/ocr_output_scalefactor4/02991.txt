1 Other Propaganda Theorists

11) Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In
fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself
(Rogers, 199i}.

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on
conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda,
and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswell is credited with creating
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, convent analysis can be
defined as, °..the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message contentinta classifications
im order to measure certain variables” (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled "Contents of Communication,”
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear ina message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasawell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that runs from centred co content and from content
to audience” (p, 74).

This method of content analysis is thed strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, “Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects” (p. 64), Cantent analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went an to doa Int of work within this area during the
remainder of his career,

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Laswell was alsa inperested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested! in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that ls presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still that information that is affecting their decisians within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing

the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories.

12 Edward Bernays (1891-1935)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opiciion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, ated public opinion. Bermays (1924)
defines propaganda as, 4 consistent, enduring effort bo create or shape events ba influence the relations of a
public to an enterprise, idea, ac group (p. 25), Contrary ta other propaganda theorists, Bemays recognizes
that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public. It can help individuals decile what to think
about ar alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to society's functioning a5 a whole,
Bemays states, “We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ides suggested, largely by
men we have never heard of... Vast cumbers af human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are ta live
a smoothly functioning society (p- 9).
eae athe ideas that saa opinion can be modified, and that such shaping Ba necessary part of
society, Bemays pursued his work in the field of public relations. “Public relacions is the athe pt, by informs106,

1955, p. 3). In the Engineering of Cansent, Bernays (1955) days out the framework for undtersacmeding the Fa
