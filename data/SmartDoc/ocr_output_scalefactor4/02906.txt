1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, ene culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was haged on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were ety Gohenda in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralizat ion and hierarchy (Hohendahl,
1995, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specihed by Adernowere the Holhowood production syst on

and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (H otkheimer and Adora
2002, p. 99). h dechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system wo ld emerge (Herkheimer and Adorno. m2,
106-7), Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaflirm the system, and Aderno cited Oreon Wel es
