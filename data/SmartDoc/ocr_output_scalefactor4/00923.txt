the formation af public opinion. In apposition ta Lippmann, who views the public 8 beeing se
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims. The public is net an amorphous Mast tite
can be molded at will or dictated te [Hernays, 1928, p. Gl). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea
that in attempting to influence the c, a business must study what terms the partnership can eh
made amicable and mutually beneficial, It must explain itself, its aims, ite objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing ta accept (p. 6B). :

Bernays elaborates on these ideas In Public Relations (142). Rather than merely attempting ta
manipulate the public through propagamda, Bernays presents public relations as 3 tool that can be
weal to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations
man helps his client adjust ta the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays,
1982, p. 0). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, a4 he recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipulation ef the public is possible, Bernaye (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations ip important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert Jeaderahip in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade ar suggest oourses of action [p. 10}, Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it is mot in auch blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists euch &8
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.
