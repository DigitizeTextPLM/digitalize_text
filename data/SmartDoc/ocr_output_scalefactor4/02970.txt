1. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in
Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative
in Europe. The closest thing in Adornos experience to the advertising industry in the United States
was fascist propaganda (Jager, 2004, p. 122). Adorno was later te allude to his experience with
the Princeton Radio Research Project im the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorne, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adore did
nt apres on the value of empirical studies, and Adorne left the project, Adornos dissatisfaction with
the work of the Princeton Hadio Research Project wouk] eventually motivate him to further develop
the ides of the culture industry.

Fecause of the relationship between the Institute for Social Reasearch and Columbia University,
Horkheimer, who had already moved to California, could net bring Adorno to fhe West Coast triit
Nowenber 2207. When Adorno nas finally able fo relocofe, he jotned an erpofriaie community bhat
included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hane Eisler, Thomas ond Heinrich Mann, Aifred DÃ©biin, and
Bertol! Brecht, several af which found work in the Hollywood monte industry. The feet that Adorno
wos part of this intellectual community woe members were tneolved in the production of Mallymood
movies wast hove had some inffuence in developing Ais thoughts on culture, since the Hollywoed syatem
inhilited the creative freedom that mony of fae expatriates hod enjoyed th Weimar Germany.

These preconditionsAdornos intercet in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, a well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the
telationship of several af these to the Hollywood film industrrare all important to an understanding of
hic concern for the idea of the culture industry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on Glo and radio did not bother to present itselfas art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn besume an ideology ta legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
{Horkhelmer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Pord were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as thes: tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl,
1895, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adornowere the Hollywood production system, or
the CHS radio network that had boon associated with the Princeton Radia Mesearch Project. hlovies
and hit songe were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
2002, p. 90). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, BOG, p.
L0G-7). Paradadcally, any inoovation would only reaffirm the ayetem, and Adana cited Crson Welles
as an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules, The elasticity in the system would
wlow it to assume the stance of any oppasition and male it ite own, ultimately Tendering it Gvefectual
(Friedman, 1981, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
af social control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of economic

coercion wltiovately meant the freedom te he the same (Horkheimer and Adarna, 2002, p. Lae.

Sines Adorno had been, in his essays on music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, The
Culture Industry has been critlclzed as being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture.
Adoro specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Sorkhelmer and
Aderno, 2002, p. IDL). [twas not high art that Adorno was presenting as an alleruative ta the culture
industry, but madernism. Although he provides the idea of an opposing force to the culture industry,
Adamo provides no overt Marxist analysis. Instead, he notes in passing that the dominant system
utilized capacities for mass consumption for entertainment or amusement,

Since Adorno had been, in his saya on music and radin, an apparent defender of high art, The
Culture Industry has been criticised as being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture,
Adorno spectiically defines avnnt-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and
Adarno, 2002, p. LOL}.
