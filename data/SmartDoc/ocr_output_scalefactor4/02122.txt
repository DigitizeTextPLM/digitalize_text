1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since ibe mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
msearch and the development of communication theary. Information exchange is a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange inftemation with the goal of reducing uncertamty. Lincer=
tong Reduction theory (RT), accredited te Charles B. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1973), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was 6 central mothee af camimunication. Through the development of WRT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “Ome of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
6 the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 133) The study of information is basic
1 all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the role of communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1975) nate: When communication restarchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
SonuTunication process, they have teeded to employ social psychological theories a starting points” ip. 9}.
The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of inter-
personal communication research; with the development of URT, communication researchers begnn to look to

cormmundeation for theories of greater liners landing mther than theoretical approaches founded in other social
Sciences.
