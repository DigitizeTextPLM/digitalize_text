Adomo was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin
hever received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adomo
became in effect Benjamins only pupil. After Benjamin’s death “it was Adomo who then introduced a rational-
ized version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (lager, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin badd
an impact on the development of Adomos theweht during this period. Retuming to Frankfurt, Adorno began
teaching at the Institute, Adorno lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi
party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Seitzerland, and the Institute began
operating there. The Nazis rise to power not only meant that Adora lost his job and would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jorgen Habermas would later note, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe
riences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 45).

1930s Adorno evidenced lithe hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
19305, Benjamin and Ademe debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “Wn the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adorno lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adon was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanica reproduction of VLSI: “ opelher
