According 1 Rogers (15541, diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation oman
nicaled through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innevabicn
is an idea, practice or object perceived a3 new by an individual or osher unit of adopticn. The diffu-
sion of @movations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).

‘Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggand:(tradational)” (Rogers, 405, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined

this term is “the degree bo which am individual is relatively earlier in adopling new ideas than ober
