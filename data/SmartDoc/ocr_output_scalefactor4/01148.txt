There are fiver different types of adopters in the diffesion process, according to [recall weness:
(1) Inexrvators (wenburescene}, (2) Barly Adopters (respectable), (7) Early Melapority (Deliberate), (41
Laie Majority (skeptical), and) Laggards (iradicional)” (Rogers, |, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined
ihis term as “the degree to which an individual i relatively earlier im adopting new Hens them ouber

When it comes to the process of innovetlon-decisions, Rogers (1995) mentioned that

there are five sages.
