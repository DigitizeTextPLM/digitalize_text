1930s Adermo evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adora debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two mast popular means
io disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “On the | etish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” 1s in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adome lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could
nore be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. ‘The reshilt was inferior to the
original, and Adore was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adome, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adorno, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea- to down of layers of imitations; to Adore, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Aderno, In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who bad succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in
New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, ron by Paul Lazars-
feld. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the iestitute, accepted
the position, although he later claimed that he did not know what a “radio project” was. For his part,
Lazarsfeld looked forvard to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be an expert on music. Adore
wrote for the Project's journal in 1941, reiterating his position that radio was only an image of a live perfor-
mance. In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio industry that the medium was bringing orate iiette
to the ae (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 243). While working at the Princeton Radio Research Project Adorno
became shocked at the degree to which culture had become commercialized in the United States. :
