Popperian Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu-
; sok Este be channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
sion of Innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 40").
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass comin
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, 5-M-C-R-E
(¢.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this 8-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, “Time” variable
is a Very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)

the innovation-decision process: (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption, Most inno-

yations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables
such as the internet.

that influence how and why users and audience adopt a new information medium,

According to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even though in the

past the individual is usually the wnit of analysis. Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in

adopting new media because new media are interactive tools and thus are required hy many users to
gain efficiency. That is, the more people use, the more people get benefits, in this sense, diffusion
theory not only can apply to practical things, buf also can be related te digital divide. ;
There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
“/1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early bee Other
Late Majority (skeptical). and (3) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers. 1995, at 183- 9). Boe
