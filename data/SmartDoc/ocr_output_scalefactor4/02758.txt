Pel dea sat ttt All Pd ellie People to be attracted to certain media Is almost as old as
ation research itself (MecQuail, 1983). Dating back ta the 1940s, researchers became
itll in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well
as daily newspaper (Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1945; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, O48: etc.) In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium
itself (Katz et al., L974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice,
support, or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important ta give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949), For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greath to establishing the structure of the approach

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in So
clology in 1956 fram Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent atademic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s te1990s (UPENN, 2001). In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Katz's mentorin Columbia University is Paul Lazarsteld, who is one ofthe pioneers of grattications research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
notion that people use the media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject
which ig knawn as the uses and gratifications research were explored. They viewed the mass media as a means
by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to
their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973).

Along with colleague lay G. Blumer, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 which
were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication, They took a more humanistic approach to looking at media
use. They suggest that media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the user and
they have alternate choices to satisfy their need. (Blurmber & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that media
served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission for both society

and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974).
