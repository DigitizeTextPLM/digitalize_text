media effects research, uses and gratifications approach is suggested to be originally a eepaetvelt ries
tionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumer & Katz, 1974). Ta some extant, however, Tun “a

effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information into the consriousness of the masses” (Watson A Hill 1997, p.

which rediacovered the relationship between media and people ocourred and led to establishment of uses
and gratifications approach.

“ bare th gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as
empirical mass communication research Itself (MeQuail, 1983), Dating back to the 140s, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well
aa daily newspaper (Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc.}. In these
studies, researchers discovered a list af functions served either by some specific content or by the medium
itself [Katz et al., 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy thelr listeners with advice,
support, of occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was abo discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structuré te the daily routine (Bereison, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions af the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and pratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known

and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz 6 served both as a sockologist and as a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in So-
cology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in Irisure, culture and communication from the 190s tolSd0s (UPENM, 2002). In

1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Penncyhania, and also directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Katz's mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, whois one of the pioneers of gratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came ee

notion that people use the media to thelr benefit. Ina study by Katz, Gurevitch and Maas (1973), a Pane
