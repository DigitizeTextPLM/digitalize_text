1. NEEDS AND GRATIFACATIONS

1 Needs and Gratifications

Wines and pratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-pevceived needs of audience mem-
bers. Blumer dhe katz (1974) concluded that diferent people can use the same communication mes-
sage for very diferent purposes, The same media content may gratify different needs for different
individuals. There ig nat onty one way that people uses media. Comtrarily, there are as many reasons
for using the media as there are media users (Bluenler & Kate, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as eeperience, interests, and
education, afect people's ideas about what they want from media and whach media best meet thelr
needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motves and gratificanians
for using different media, MoCluadl, Blumer, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-perion
interactions” to cacsify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from rowtine oF
problems: emotional release: (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility: (4) Personal
identity: 461 reference; reality exploration: value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance [forms of informa-
Hon seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was sugpested by MoGuire (1974), based
ona general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cogretive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus

“internal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use [Figure 1). Figure 2. A
structuring of 16 general paradignrs ef human motivation [MoGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurewtch end Haas
[1973] developed 35 needs taken fram the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
put them ieto five categories:

_ Cognitivr needs, including acquiring inormabion, kressledge and waderstanding:
_ Affective ceeds, intlueing emotion, pleasure, feelings:
_ Pertonal integrating meeds, including credibility, stodrtihy stator,
