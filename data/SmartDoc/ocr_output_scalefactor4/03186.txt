party, Herkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the eee
opernting there. The Nazis rise to power not only meant that Adorno lost his job and would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jtirgen Habermas would Later neste, Clee
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical six oy
riences influencing the development of critical thbary, the athers being Stalinist repression and the production
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48).

Adare was at Oxford from 1934 to 1938, where he worked on a manuscript on Husserl. He was considered
an outsider, newer integrating into the British academic mainstreasn, and he looked forward to joining his Frank-
furt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved te the United States. Already in the late
1930s Adore evidenced little hope for mass culture, As propaganda ane entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means
a disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships, The essay translated as “Om the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adomo lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, svimphonic works could
now be heard ower the radia, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adomo was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adamo, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film

essential of the artistic authenticity, To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
éuthority of Platonic onder from the top-the original or ideo- to down of layers of imitations; to Adama, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authentieloy. The general aptitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adora. In 1838 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing a felationsbip for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in
Mew York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, run by Paul Lazars-
feld. Adorno, anions to leave Britain in the bopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
