To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on tWO levers, gpm talon ere
by speaking actors. The former is called lang we and the latter parole. hes spall chain iors

On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. fal
itis considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from
shared convention, the siructure.

4 language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. It Is the social part of
language, itis essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one
wishes to communicate. Itis because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is canseque ntly a social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which Is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
af the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is

essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual act and not to a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the extemal part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English of in Korean are the extemal forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they aré parts" (Saussure, 1959, in FR. Innis
(ed.), p. 37). The correspondence of the concept/meaning to the external farm is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. lt is not the inevitable internal relation but the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that ‘anguage does
not reflect a pré-axistent and extemal feality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from

within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences" According to Saussure, "meaning
iS produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic

(6.9. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (@.g., synonyms), organized into a signifying system" (Barker
2002, 9. 25). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic communi
members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the follow,
ing sentence: “I went to a theater with my girlfriend.” This sentance is established thr h he
linear cambination of slang. The signs within the example, such as | theater m eee SUM Te
