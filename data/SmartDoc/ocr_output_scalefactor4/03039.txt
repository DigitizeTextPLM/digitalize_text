1930s, Benjamin and Adomo debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means
to disserminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art inthe Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1909, p. 62). A pr-
mary problem for Adorno lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adomo was emphate: in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
With sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu

essential of the artistic authenticity, To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenee against the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea- to down of layers of imitations; to Adorno, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adorno. In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establis hing a relationship for the
