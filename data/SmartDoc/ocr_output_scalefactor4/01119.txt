1. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Hhesearch condicted uncer the tite of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion,
intial influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of leaming, dissonance, bal-
ance, social jodpmen, amd reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social paychology,
flayed a considerabee role in infloeecing interpersonal research piuneers such as Festinger, Heider,
Kelley, and Hovland, By the 1970s, research inierests began io shit into che realm of social interaction,
relational developenent, and relational control. This was influenced by the reseanch of sect schalars
a3 R.inapp, Mehrabian, Aloman, Taylor, Dasck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the decade
and into ihe 19805, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Rodlaff, amd Berger became popalar
along with research inte behavioral and communicative sdaptacion by (Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson.
Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays belped shape che interpersonal comm research
agenda during the past two decades” (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends io focus
oo dyadic communécation, comimunication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as
a function of developing relationships. Research inte interpersonal comnvunication theory typically

focuses on the developenent, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. Ut has been recognized

ieunication is motivated by uncertainty peductian (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).
Since its in con inthe 1970s, uncertainty has. been recognized asa major field of spody that has
commibuted to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus
anuthose theorists who pioneered the research of ancemaanty reduction in communécation. Their werk
is cnacial io the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our
understanding of inenpersenal processes,

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since ancenainty has been identified ai an important comeinect, necessary bo he study of commu
nication, it would be beneficial io lonow whem the concept originased, and how it has been defined
and studied. (One way bo consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory, Shanon and Weaver (1949) proposed thal wnceriainty existed ie a given situation when there
was a high ameunt of possible alpematives and che probahi fiheir ever was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the tranamission of meisapes, bot their work
also comiributed to the development of WRT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted comeepes from the
information theorests as well as Heider (2958) research in atiribulicm. Berger and Calabrese (15975)
expanded the concept od ancemalmry 10 fit interpersonal communication by defindeg mcertainty as
the “number of albernative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p, 100) The grearer the
bevel af uncertainty that exists in a sicoatiem, the smaller the chance imeividuals will be able io pre-
dict behaviors and oeqerences. Derieg inerecthorrs individuals are nat only faced with problems ot

that they do, Benger amd Bradac's (1982) definition of uncemaincy highlighted the complexity of this
process when they sated: “Urcertainty, then, cas stem from the large nimber of aliemativy Things
that a stranger can believe or potentially say" Uncertainty plays a significance role wher examining
relationships. High Jewels of uncertainty cam severely inhibit relational development. Uncertainty con:
