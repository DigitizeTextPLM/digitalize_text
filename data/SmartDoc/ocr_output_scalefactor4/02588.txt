Ligaen (Bernays, 1955, p22). Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent 4 different pr af
formation of public opinion, In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily
toanipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which
CAD be molded at will or dictated to (Hernavs, 1928, p. Gi). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea
that in atternpting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership ean be
made amicable and mutually beneficial, It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the
public im terms which the public cam understand and le willing be accept (p. 66).
Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate: the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations 05 a tool that can be
eed to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The obyjective-minded public relations

roan helps his client acljust to the contemporary situation, oT lelpa the public adjuat to it (Hernays,
1052, p. #). Bernays view of the public is gafter than that of Lippmann, 85 he recognizes the power od
society, but still aleo claims that manipaelasiat of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public rejations, To citizens 10 general, public relations is irupartant becaee it helpa thea
to understand the seciety of which we Bre all a part, bo know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
te exert leadership in mocifving renditions that affects us, to evaluate efforta being made by athers,
and to persuade oF eoures of action (p. 10}. Under this framework, while manipulation af
the public is stil] possible, it 75 not in euch blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such a8

Lippmann acd Ellul tended to disagree with this point.
