Rogers was bom in Carroll, lowa in 1931. He eamed his B.A.. M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from lowa
State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Foree. Interestingly,
in 1966, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea.

Tha boc has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it ereats applications of CTT
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology. political science, and, as previously
mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was
suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2003.

According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass COMMU
nication peaple can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful: Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, §-M-(C-R-E
(e.g. sender-message-channel-receiver-ellect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this §-M-C-R-E commul-
nication medel corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea ot product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption of social change. In the diffusion theory, “Time! variable
is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffision research has attempted to explain the variables
