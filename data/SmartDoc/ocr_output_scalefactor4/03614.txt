ee Sma Of public opinion. In opposition ta Lippmann, who views the public as being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is nat an amorphous mass which
tan he melded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66}, Instead, Bernaya (1928) offers the idea
that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be
made amicable and Tmutually beneficial, 1 must explain itself, its aims, its phjectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and i= willing to accept (p. GB).

Beérnays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1062). Rather than merely attempting to
Manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presenta public relations as a tool that can be
ued to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader, The objective-minded public relations
nan helps his client adjust to the comtemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Hemays,
1952, p, 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recopniice: the power of
society, but stall also claims that manipulation of the public is possible, Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifving con ne that affects ws, to evaluate efforts being made hy others,
and to persuade of Sugeest courges of action [p. 10). Unter this framework, while manipulation of
the public ie still possible, it is net in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul tended te disagree with this paint.

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily ba both the direct effects and limited effects
media models, Theorists such as Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct effecta model, whereby
propaganda could directly influence the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippmann
also noted that the media might not be influencing oxy thought, but may als be influencing what
people thought about. Tt was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting point for future research
in the area of the limited effects of the media, Such limited effects were shown through the work af
Iyengar and Kinder, aa well as McCombs and Shaw. Overall, the research af the echolara discussed in
this paper has been very important to the understanding of the media, the manipulation af the public,
and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Elbal
were formed years ago, they continue to help us understand the society that surrounds us today.
