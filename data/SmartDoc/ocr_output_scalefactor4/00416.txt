Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the
relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important to an understanding of
his concern for the idea af the culture industry.

For Adorno, popular culture an fl and radio did nat bother to present itself as art. They were instead
id a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
a : (Horkbeimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business waz based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitalism, in whieh nase production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insafar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl,

; 1595, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adormowere the Hollkwood production system, or
the CHS radia network that had been assoriabed with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula cupplante the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
S002, p. $0). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the eysber
and that oothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkhelmer amd Adome, 2002 =
106-7}. Paradoxically, any innovation would only reatiinm the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles
a2 an example of someone whe was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would
low it to assuine the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual
(Friedman, 1981, p. 166). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
of social eanitrel (Horkheimer and Adarno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of eoonemic
coercion ultimately meant the freedom to be the same (Horkheimer and Adorno, M2 136)
