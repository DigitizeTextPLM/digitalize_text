Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. U'ncer-
tainty Reduction theory (LRT), accredited to Charles R. Bergerand Richard J. Calabrese (1975), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship if uncertainty
research. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 153). ‘The study of information is basic
to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the role of communication into the central
focus which was a kev step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (19745) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social paychological theories as starting points” (p. 94).
The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of inter-
personal communication research; with the development of URT, communication researchers began to look to
communication far thearkes of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social

SCbenioes.

1.2 The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Traditionally, communication has been viewed as an interdisciplinary field. Interpersonal communication is

most often linked to studies into language, social cognition, and social psychology. Prior to the 160s, only a

molest amount of research was completed under the label of interpersonal communication. Heath and Bryant
(2000) marked this time a8 the origin of the field of interpersonal communication: “Particularly since 1960,
scholars adopted communication os the central term because they wanted fe stwaly it as osignificanr and unique
ayeect of human behavior” (p. 29). 7 he Pots produced research that impacted the develapment of an in-
terpersonal field. Reseorch in psychiatry examined personality and the influence of relationships, finding that
paychiatric problems were not only a result of self problems, but a result of relational problems as well. Re-
search trends in humanistic psychology and existentialism inspired the idea that relationships could be improved
