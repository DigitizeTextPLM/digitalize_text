Uncertainty Reduction

1.100 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation far communication
research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a basic human function in
whieh individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. (mcer-
tainty Reduction theory (URT), accredited to Charles R_ Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communicateon. Through the development of UT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncerainty
research, Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
ig the acquisition of information with which ta reduce uncertainty” (p, 153). The study of information is basic
to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study af uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. LIRT places the role of communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development af the field of interpersonal communication, Benger and Cal-
abrese (1975) nate: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research om the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social paychological theories as dtarting. peiines” {p. oo),
The research underlying the theary and efforts made by other cantemporaries marked the cmergence of inter=
personal communication research; with the development ef LRT, communication researchers began to look to

communication for thearies of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social

sciences.
