1. Defining Uncertainty

Since ancertainty has been identified as an important constrict, necessary to the amudy of comiva-
nication, it would be beneficial io Know when the concep! originated, and how i has been defined
and studied. Cine way to consider uncertainty is threagh the theoretical framework of information
theory, Shannon ard Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertaanty existed in a given sibaalnm when there
was a high amount of possible alternatives amd the probabiliry of their event wes relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver celaned this view of unceralmy 10 the tramacnission of messages, bul tein work
