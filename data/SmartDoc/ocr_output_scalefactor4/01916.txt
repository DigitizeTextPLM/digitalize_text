To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic hese pe? dae

On the contrary, parole is flexible because it ig the actual expression at the individua ae ean
itis considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot ‘om

resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both Institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing hig personal thowght, It is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that It comesponds to and individual act and notte @ pure

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through ihe form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, beth thee word
dog in English or in Korean are the extemal forms expressing the actual animal dog, Here, the aciual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "| propose to retain the word sign (signe) ta
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifier (significant); the last two temns have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are paris” (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis
fed), p. 37). The comespondence of the conceptimesning te the extemal form is notin the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation, itis mot tre inevitable internal relation but the difference
between the signs that aperabes the signifying system. Saussure (1950) argues that language does
moi reflect a prexishent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning fram
within self through a series of conceptual and phonic differences’. According to Saussure, “meaning
is produced through @ process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic
(29. @ Séntence) and the paradigmatic (o.9., synonyme}, organized inte a signifying system” (Barker,
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
Same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the follow-

ing sentence: “I went to a theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence is established through the
linger combination of signs, The signe within the example, such as | theater, my, and girlfriend can be
substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as "S rant wi
