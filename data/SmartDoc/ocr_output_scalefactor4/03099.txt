itis well accepted that communication theories have developed through the realms of psychology and so-
cology over the past 100 years. With illumed by valuable ideas as well as exploring more untilled fields in these
me disciplines, researchers élicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding media. As a sub-tradition of
media effects research, uses and gratifications approach is suggested to be originally stemmed from a func-
Hanalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blurnler & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional theory
on communication agrees with media's effects towards people. For example, a model often used in the the-
ory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential
effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information into the consciousness of the masses” (Watson & Hill 1997, p.
105). Functional theory influenced studies on cammunication from the 1920s te the 1940s. After that, a shift
which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses
and gratifications approach.
The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as
empirical mass communication research itself (Mccuail, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such a8 $0ap operas and quizzes, as well
as daily newspaper (Lazmsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc). In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by same specific content or by the medium
itself (Katz et al., 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice,
support, or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”
Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era, Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, [ lihu Katz is one of the mast well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.
Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher, He received his PhO. in Se
clology in 1956 from Columbla University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963 During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led ta his subsequent academic work es
