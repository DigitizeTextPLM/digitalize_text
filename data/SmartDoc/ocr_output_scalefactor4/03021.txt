Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, an
education, affect people's ideas about what they want fram media and which media best meet their
needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state thelr own motives and gratifications
| for using different media. MeQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of media-person
interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or

problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal

identity: self reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance (farms of infonme-

tion seeking.

| Anether subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based
| an a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” Initiation, “external” versus

“internal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,

| these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch and Haas

(1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
put therm inte five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding:
2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;
4. Personal integrative needs, including credibility stability, stots;
4. Sociol integrotive needs, including interacting with fomily and friends: and

5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion,
