1 Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

Inarder to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry aa well as is reception the concept can bee
exantined chronologically, fram its pre-condition’, through its generation, to its subsequent impact. The idea of
the culture industry grows aut of a concer with culture, is developed through insights into the mechanical re=
production of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music, but alse to Hollywood
movies, That this Is so grows aut of a number of historical camingencies.

Adorno was introduced ta Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two thearisis became frlends. Since Benjamin
never received a degree that would allow him to teach at 4 university, according to Hannah Arends, Adarne
became in effect Benjamins only pupil, After Benjamin’s death “it was Adome who then introduced a rational
ized version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (Higer, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had
an impact on the development of Adormas thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adame began
teaching at the Institute. Adomo lost his right to teach in September 1933 duc ta the rise > pawer of the: Maxi
party, Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switrerland, and the Inaritute began
operating there, The Nazis rise to power not only meant that Adame lost his job and would eventually force his
departure fram Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought, As Jirgen Habermas would later note, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe-
riences influencing: the development of critical theary, the others being Stalinist repression and the production
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48).

Adorno was at Oxford from 1934 to 198, where he worked of a manuseript an Husserl. He was considered
an cursider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frank-
furt Schoo! colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the late
1930s Adore evidenced little hope for mass culture, As propaganda and enterininment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adome debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most papular maar
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The esiay translated as “Cn the Fetish

Charsoter in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62) A pri-
mary problem for Adorno lay in the fect that instead of being enjoyed ina concert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard aver the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adora was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with spect and film, mass music and the new listening help lo make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adorno, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film

as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, 10 Adomo, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea- to down of layers of imitations; to Adomo, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
wae that of Adame. Im 1938 Max Horkbeimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Sucial Research with Columbia University that enabled the [ostitute te continee working in
New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, run by Paul Lazars-
feld. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although he later claimed that he did not know what o “radin project” wos, For his part,
Lazarsfeld looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be an expert on music. Adomo
wrote for the Project's journal in 1941, reiterating his position that radio was only an image of a live perfor
mance. In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio industry that the medium was bringing serious music
to the masses (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 243) While working at the Princeton Radio Research Project Adore
became shocked at the degree ta which culture had become commercialized in the United States.

Ademo was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends, Since Benjamin
never received o degree that would allow him to teach at @ university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adomp
became in effect Benjamins only pupil. After Benjamin's death “it was Adamo who then introduced a rational-
ized version of his ideas into academic philosophy,” (Jiger, 2004, p. 63-6), The relationship with Benjamin had
an impact on the development of Adomos thought during this period, Retuming to Frankfurt, Adomo began
teaching at the Institute. Adorno lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nati
party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began

operating there.
