1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-bwentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong fourdation for communication
research and the development of communication theary, Infarmation exchange is a Gasic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Uacer=
tainty Reduction theery (URT), accredited to Charles R_ Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), secognized thas
reducing uncertainty was a central motive ef communication. Through the development of UT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research, Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning inerpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p, 153). The study of information is basic
to all fields of communication, but its relatian to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT place: the role of communication inte tbe central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1973) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the inberpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories as starting points” (jp, 79).
‘The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other cantemporaries marked the emergence of inter
personal communication research; with the development of UIRT, communication researchers began ta look to
communication for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social

Sciences.
