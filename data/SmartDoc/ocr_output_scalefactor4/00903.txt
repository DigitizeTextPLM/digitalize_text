It is well accepted that communication theories have developed through the realms of psychology and so
ciology over the past LOO years, With illumed by valuable ideas as well as exploring more untilled fields in these
two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding media. As a sub-tradition of
media effects research, uses and grat fications approach is sugpest ed ta be originally stemmed fram a func-
tionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional theory
on communication agrees with media's effects towards people. For example, a model often used in the the-
ory, the Hypadermic Syringe model, discusses that "the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential
effect Upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information inte the consciousness of the masses” (Watson & Hill 19/, p.
105). Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1940s. After that, a shift
which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led ta establishment of uses
and pratiiications approach.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as
empirical mass communication research itself (McQuail, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such as soap operas and quizzes, a5 well
as daily newspaper [Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 194% Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc.). In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium
itself (Katz et al., 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice,
support, or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics

of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelsan, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Amang
the group of scholars whe focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greathy to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in So-
ciology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the mext thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem, In the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s tol990s (UPENN, 2001). In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and alo directed its

experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Katz's mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsteld, whois one of the pioneers of pratifications research,
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of pratifications with the
functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
notion that people use the media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject
which Is known as the uses and gratifications research were explored, They viewed the mass media as a means
by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to
thelr needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 which
were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication, They took a more humaniste approach ta lacking at media
use. They suggest that media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the user and
they have alternate choices te satisty their need. (Blumler & Katz, 1974). They alse discovered that media
served the functions of surveillance, correlahion, entertainment and cultural transmission for both society
and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974),
