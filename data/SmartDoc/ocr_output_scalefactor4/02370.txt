k s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger became popular
along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson.
Berger (2005) States: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal comm research
agenda during the past two decades" (p, 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus
on dyadic communication, communication invelving face-to-face interactlon, or communication as
a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically
focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized
that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).
Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has
contributed to the development of the field of communication a awhole. This chapter strives to focus
on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work
is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our

understanding of interpersonal processes.

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, Mecessary to the study of commu-
nication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how’ it has been defined
and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there
was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability af their event was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmis fon of messa BES, but their wa ts
also contributed te the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts Ero ts
information theorists a5 well as Heider (1958) research in attribution. Benger and Calabrese (19) 5)
