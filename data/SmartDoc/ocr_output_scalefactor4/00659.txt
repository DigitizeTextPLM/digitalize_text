on communication agrees with media's effects towards praple. For example, a model atten its yaaa
ory, the Hypadermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate an ue

effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ infarmation Inte the cansceais mess ofthe masses” (Watson & Hill 1297, p.

105). Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 940s, After that, a shift

which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses
and cations approach. .

Lili eager gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost a8 old a5
empirical mass communication research itself (McQuail, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers aes
interested in the reasons far viewing different radia programmers, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well
as dally newspaper (Laarsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc), In these
eudies, researchers discovered a list of functions served elther by some specific content or by the medium
itself (Katz et al, 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy thelr listeners with advice,
support, oF occasions for emotional release [Herog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
infarmation, newspaper was ao discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
af converiation and a structure to the daily routine (Beretson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions af usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term "gratfications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the tate 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is ome af the rast well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Kate i served both as a sociologist and a3 4 communication researcher He received his Ph.D, in So-
clolagy in 1956 fram Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicaga until 1963, During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. in the late 1960. invited by the Government of israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 2970s to1990s (UPEMN, 2001). In
1993, he joined the faculty of the Anmenberg Schoo! at the University of Pennaylvania, and alse directed its
experimental Scholars program far post-dactoral study.

Katz's mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, whois one of the peoneers of pratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theory model. Later, Kate intraduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with ie
notion that peogle use the media to their benefit. Ina study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject
