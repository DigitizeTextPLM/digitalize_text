(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-CR-E
(e.g., sender-message-channel-teceiver-effect), Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this $-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(3) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variable
is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1999), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Ovffiesion mesearch hos atenpted fo explain the variables

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
#(1) Innovators {venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (iraditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
memibers of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p, 40). Figure | shows the relationships between types
