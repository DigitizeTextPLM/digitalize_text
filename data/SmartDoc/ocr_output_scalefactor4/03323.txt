it is well accepted that communication theories have developed through the realms of psychology and sa-
ciology aver the past 100 years. With illumed by valuable ideas as well as exploring more untilled fields in these
two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding media. As a sub-tradition of
media effects research, uses and gratifications approach is suggested to be originally stemmed from a func-
tionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional theory
on communication agrees with media's effects towards people. For example, a model often used in the the-
ory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential
effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information into the consciousness of the masses” (Watson & Hill 1997, p.
105). Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1940s. After that, a shift
which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses

and gratifications approach.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost a5 old as
empirical mass communication research itself (McQuail, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well

as dally newspaper {Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1548; etc.) In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium
itself (Katz et al., 19746}. For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice,
support, Or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering

information, newspaper was alsa discovered to be important ta give readers a sense of security, shared topics

of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing In the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approa nit was rediscovered during that era, Among

ch were proposed whe

the group af scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.
