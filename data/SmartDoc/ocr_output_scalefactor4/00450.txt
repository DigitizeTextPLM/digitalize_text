‘The audience is conceived as active, i.e., an important part of of mass media a “
assumed to be goal oriented ... patterns of media use are shaped by more a Pos
definite expectations of what certain kinds af content have to offer the audience

member.
In the mass communication process much initiative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on
theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and
behavior.

_ The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
mass communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs,
and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media conmsump-
tion certainly varies.

_ Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- ie., people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in
particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms. (p. 15-1).

In addition, Katz, Blumer, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous researches on
pratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people on the media, they did not address the
connections between these gratifications (Kate et al, 1974a), They suggested that uses and gpratifi-
cations research concern with following aspects: “(1) the social and the psychological origins of (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) dif
ferential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in (6) need gratification and (7) other
CONSeqQueNnces, perhaps mostly unintended ames” (Katz et al, 19%4b, p. 20). The studies of Kate and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the uses and eratifications approach. Since
then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The current stat sof :

1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses and pratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audi
