I. CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Mra 5. of the rea renal the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing
jue opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bertiays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase,
ed eee Me ear He pe Engineering implies planning: And it is careful planning more
anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity and
propaganda {Bernays, 1945, p22). Furthermore, Bernays theories alsa represent a different view of
the Hoe af public opinion. In opposition to Lappanann, who views the public as being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. €6), Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea
that in attempting to influence the public, business must study what terms the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives. ta the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 66).
Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
Tianipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presente public relations as a tool that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader, The objective-minded public relations
man helpe his client adjust to the contemporary aituation, or helpe the public adjust to it (Bernays,
1952, p. 9). Bernays view ef the public is softer than that af Lippmann, a he recognizes the power af
Bbriety. hut still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible, Bernays (1052) writes of the
henefita of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important becarase it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persumle or suggest courses wf action (p. 10). Uneer this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public ppinion, Theorie such as
Lippanann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed dy Lippmann, Dasrwell, Eifui, ated Bernoys are important for a number of

reasons. Based on the ideas of his predeccasors, Lippmann was able to bring affention to fhe fret that
the public is ake to be influenced by the media, The work of Lippmann and héy colleagues has fed to more
recent regearch that is meant to help understand the infleence af the media on the public. Through the
mork Iyengar and Kinder, White, Lewin, and MeCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensive understanding
af the media has been developed. The public haa now been made aware tirious medio fimefions such a8

their audiences.

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily te both the direct effects and limited effecta
imedia models. ‘Theorists sech as Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
propaganda could directly influence the thought efthe mawes, Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippmann

people thought abyot. Lt was thin line of thinking that resulted in a starting point for future research

=n the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work of
Lyengar and Kinder, a8 well as MeCombe and Shaw. Overall, the research of the acholars discussed in
this paper has been very important to the understanding af the media, the manipulation of the public,
and the formation of public apinien, While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul
were formed years ago, they continue to help us understand the society that surrounds us today.
