Stare University. For toc years during the Korean War, be served in the U.S. Air Force. Inierestingly,
in 1960, be worked om some family planning communication projects in Korea.

The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creats applications af diffu-
dom theory in such fields as geography, econamEs, peychology. political science, and, as previously
mreetioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was

According to Rogers (196), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innowation is oommu-
nicated through certain channels ower time among ihe members of a social system. An inmovation
is an ides, practice or object perceived as mew by an individual or other unit af adoption. The diffe
sion of innowations involves both) mass media and imserpersonal communication channels” (p. 40%),
That is, by sharing communication channels such af interpersonal ecenmundcalige OF Mus COMTITie-
