1. CRITICAL RESPONSE TO "THE CULTURE INDUSTRY"

He complained to the dean about the radical students in his classes who were making
teaching impossible. in the winter term of 1968-69 students occupied a number of buildings
at the University at Frankfurt, including the Institute for Social Research After the strike
ended, Adorno returned to teaching, but his lectures continued to be disrupted, including
one “tasteless demonstration” in which three females bared their breasts. Adorne died a few
months later (Jager, 2004, p. 201-08).

4 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culture industry outside of a German context, In the years since there have been numer-
ous criticisms of the text, not least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about “ihe
commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adorno arred in not discussing the processes of cul-

tural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorna and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology be-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes In the grip of an all-pernasive reification (Eagleton,
4991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
among oppressed peoples In society has some part to play in the reproductian of the sy
tem as a whole’ (Eagleton, 7991, p. 36). Fredric Jameson nointed out that Adorma's idea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the saciety that developed in the 1950s
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available dung the 19403
While the idea of the culture industry can be defend ed as a useful theary for industrial soci-
eties between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its affactiveness (Hahendanhl,
4995, p. 146-48) Thus. for a some efitics, the value of the idea of the culture industry wold
appear to be merety historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value at alll.
