Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural i
To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates an two levels, the maak system and eee
by speaking actors. The former is called langue aind the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set
of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which compose
it; as Oppesed to it, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language" (Barthes, 1987,
p14). Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level,
langue, is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized,
On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However,

itis considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free fron the
shared convention, the structure, — -

A language is therefore, -a secial institution and a system of values. It is the social part of
language, itis essentially a collective contract which one must accept in as entirety if one
wishes to communicate. it is because a language le a system of contractual values that if
resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that # corresponds to and individual act and mot to a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1957, pp. 14-15}

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system inte two parts, tha
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept of meaning which is expressed tureagh ihe fon.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the external forrns expressing the acheal animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes ihe signified. “| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (eignifie) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them fram each other and from the whole of which they are parts” (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis
(ed,.}, p. 37). The correspondance of the concept'meaning to the extemal form is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable intemal relation but the difference
between the signs that oparates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues thal language does.
not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from
within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences". According to Saussure, "meaning
is produced through a process ef selection and combinabon of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic
fe.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g.. synonyms). organized into a signifying system’ (Barker,
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the follow-
ing sentence: "I went to 4 theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence is established through the
linear combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as | theater, my, and girlfriend can be
substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as "She went to a restaurant with her mother.
Throwgh the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated onhy when
they are related to each other, “Crucially, signa do nat make sense by virtue of reference to entities in
an independent object world; rather, they generale meaning By reference ta each other. Thus, oe
ing is understood as a social convention organized through the relations between signs (Barker, Ce
2002, p, 29). “itis central to Saussures argument that red is meaningful in relation to the ila
between red, green, amber, etc, These signs are then organized into & sequence which generates
