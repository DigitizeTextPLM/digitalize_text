Five basic assumpeions were stated ina study of Katz, Blumler, and Gureviteh in 1974 as fnlhows,
‘They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media and audiences:

definite expectations al what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience

In addition, Katz, Blomler, and Gurevich also commented chat, although previous researches on
grabfications detected diverse pratifications that attract people on the media, they did not address the

his calleagaes laid a theoretical foondaion of butkding the uses and pratifications approach. Since
then, dhe research on this subject has been smengthened and exiended. The cunren stanis of uses and
gratificatons is still based on Bate’s first analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in
such an electeanic infcemation age when people have more options of media use.
