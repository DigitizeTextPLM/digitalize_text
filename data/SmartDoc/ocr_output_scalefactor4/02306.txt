I. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research copducted under the title of imerpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion,
social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, bal-
ance, SoCal judgment, afd reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social
Played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider,
Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction,
telational development, and relational comrol This was influenced by the research of such scholars
a5 Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibeot. During the later part of the decade
and into the 1380s, the copnitive apptoaches of Hewes, Planalp, Rolodf, and Berger became popular
along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson.
Berger (20005) stanes: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal comm research

agenda during the past two decades" (ip, 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus
on dyadic communication, comenunicalion involving face-to-face interaction, ar communication as
a function of developing relationships. Research into imerpersomal communication theory typically
focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolucion of relationships. In has been recognized
that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).
Since its introduction im the 1975, umcemainty bas been recognized asa major field of study that has
coniriboted to the developenent af the field of comenunication as awhole. This chapter strives in focus
on chose theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work
is onacial te the develegaeent of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our
understanding of incerpersomal pracesses,

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since ancenainty has been identified as. am imgecetant comstnoct, necessary po the shady of commu-
ication, it would be beneficial io know when the concept originated, and how it has beem defined
and studied. One way oo consider wacestainny is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed im a given situation whem chere

expanded the concep of wacertainty to fit intenperscnal conmmvanication by definang uncertainty as
the “number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p, 100. The greaser the

predicting present and past behaviors, bul aso explaming why partners behave or believe in the way
that they do. Berger and Bradac's (1932) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this
process when they sated: “Uncertainty, then, as stems from th large number of almnative things
