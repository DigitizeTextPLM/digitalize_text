Hat 1s, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu-
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-C-R-E
(e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this §-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(3) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variable
is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables
that influence how and why users and audience adopt anew information medium, such as the Internet.
According to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even though in the
past the individual is usually the unit of analysis. Also, critical mass becomes an important jactor int
adopting new media because new media are interactive tools and thus are required by many users fo
gain efficiency, That is, the more people use, the more people get henefits. Jn this sense, diffusion
theory not only can apply to practical things, fut also can be related to digital ativicte
There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innowatiweness:
“(1) Innovators (venturesome)}, (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditionaly" (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185), Rogersdefined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure 1 shows the relationships between types
