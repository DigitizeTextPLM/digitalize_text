Adomo was intreduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends, Since Benjamin
never received a degree that would allow him to tench at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adomo
became in effect Benjamins only pupil. After Benjamin's death “it waa Adomo who then introduced a rational-
ined version of his ideas into academic Philosophy.” Wager, 2004, p. 65-0). The relationship with Benjamin had
an ihpact on the development of Adoros thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adora began
teaching at the Institute, Adore lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise t power of the Nazi
party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began
operating there. The Nazis rise to power not only meant that Adomo lost his job and would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Firgen Habermas would laser note, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe-
riences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the productian
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p, 48).

Adorno was at Oxdiord from 1934 to 1998, where be worked on a manuscript an Husserl. He was considered
an outsider, never imegrating into the British academic mainstream, ard he looked forward to joining his Frank-
furt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantine moved te the United States. Already in the late
19305 Adore evidenced lithe hope for tats culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1830s, Benjamin and Adomo debsted mass culture, since film and radia became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “Om the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's nore

plimistic eseay, “The Work of Art inthe Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62) A pri-
mary problem for Adora lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed ina concert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adora was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the mew listening help to make cocape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adorno, 2001b. p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
gs the emancipation from hisrarchical tastes tied to class, to Adomo, the aura of the orginal artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge opainst the
authority of Platenic order from the top-the original or Ides- to down of layers of imitations, to Adorno, mais
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adorno. In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to comtinue working im
New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, run by Paul Lazars-
feld, Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although he later claimed that be did not know what a “radio project” was. For his part,
Lagzarsfeld looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be an expert on musket, Adorno
wrote for the Project's journal in 1941, reiterating his position that radio was only an image of a live perfor-
mance, In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio industry that the medium was DMNging Sera: muLe
