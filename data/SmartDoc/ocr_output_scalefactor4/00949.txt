1. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in
Europe, Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with ne correlative
in Europe, The closest thing in Adornog experience to the advertising industry in the United States
was fascist propaganda (Jiiger, 2004, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience with
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical
diviskon of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did
not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project, Adernos dissatisfaction with

the work ef the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop
the idea of the culture industry,

Becouse of the relationship between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University,
Horkheimer, wha had already moved to California, could not bring Adorno to the West Coast uniil
November 1942. When Adorno wos finally able to relocate, Ae joined aon expatriate community that
included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenterg, Hons Bisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Doblin, and
Bertolt Brecht, aeverol of which found work in the Hollywood morte industry. The fact that Adorno
was part of this intellectual community whose members were involved in the production of Hollywood
movies must hove had come influence in developing his thoughts on cultnre, since the Aoliwood ayetem
inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates hod enjoyed in Metmar Germany.
These preconditions Adornos interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the

Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriabe comumunity in California and the

relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important to an understanding of
his coneern for the idea of the colture industry.

19 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead
a business, and this in tum became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimes and Adora, 2002, p. 05). This business: was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitalicin, in which mas production based on the techniques used by Henry Pord were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as thee tendenckes were based on centralization and hierarchy (HMobendahl,
1986, p. 142), Examples of thismot specitied by Adornmowere the Hollywood production system, or
the CBS radia neswork that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work [Horkheimer and Adorno,
S008, p. 900. Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the syatem,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would amenge (Horkhelmer and Adorno, 2002, p.

coercion ultimately meant the eer ae be the same (Horkheinier anc Acdorme, 2008, iP 1d6).
