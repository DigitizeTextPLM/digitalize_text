Focusing on the systematic level, Sausuire distinguishes the language system inte two parts, the
signified and the signifier The signified is a concept or meaning which ts expressed thraugh the torn.
The form is called the signifier, which is the extemal part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog, Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified, “| propose to retain the word sign (signe) te
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signitied (signifie) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts” (Saussure, 1959, in PL lrg
fed), p. 37). The correspondence of ihe conceptimeaning te the external form ls notin the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitabee internal relation bul the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that “language does
