In addition, Keer, Abumler, and Gurevitch also commenoed that, although previous researches on
gratifications deeected diverse gracificathons that attract people on the media, they did moe address the
tonnections between these gratifications [Karz et al, 11743), They suggested that uses and gratifi-
tations research concem with following aspects: “(1) the social amd che psychological origins of (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) he mass media or other sources which lead in (5) dif-
ferential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting im (5) need geetification and (7) other
Consequences, perhaps mosily uninnended ones" (Kate etal, 197, p. 20) The studies of Bare aed
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building ihe uses and gratifications approach. Sance
then, the research on this subject has been sirengihened and extended. The carrent satus of uses and

individuals, There is not only ane way that people uses media. Comerarily, there are as many nesses
for using the media as there are media users (Plumler & Karz, 1974). ;
