2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitulist society inta a systematic context, as appased to
other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. G09). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent [Alway, 1995, p. 83). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were to
maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideslogy that maintained that control.
Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions
(Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, it is difficult in Marcuses argument to separate caliure:
or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass
media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the sane Way that. Ad crn
had done. In the end Marcuses analysis of society allowed for mo opposition to the dominant
ideology. Mareuse wrote, "how can the administered individualswho have made thelr mutilation
