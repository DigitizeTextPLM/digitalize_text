Uses and Gratifications

1.1. Introduction

Uses and gralificafions approach is an influential tradition in media research, The original
conception of the approach was based on the research for axplaining the great appaal of
certain media contents. The core question of such research is: Why do peapie use media
and what do they use them for? (MoCuail, 1893). There exists a base idea in this approach :

& Tankard, 1997). As a broader perspective among Communication msearches, it pro-
vides a framework for understanding the processes by which media participants seak
information of content selectively, commensurate with their needs and interests (Katz
