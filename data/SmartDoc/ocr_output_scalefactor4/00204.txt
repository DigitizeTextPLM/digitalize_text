1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead
a lvusiness, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
|Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl.
1995, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adornowere the Hollywood production system, or
the (CBS radio network that had been assomated with the Princeton Radia Hesearch Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Aderna
2002, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system,

and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno. 2009. p
106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles
