A, domo was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin
ei received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adora
became int effect Benjamins only pupil. After Benjamin's death “it w ag Adora mite then introduced a avenab
ized version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (Jiger, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had
an impact on the development of Adomos thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began
teaching at the Institute. Adorno lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi

party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began
operating there. The Nazis rise to power not only meant that Adome lost his job and would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jlirgen Habermas would later note, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe-

riences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production

of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48).

furt School colleagues, many of whom had in the me time moved to the United States. Already in the late
19305 Adomo evidenced littl hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” 1s in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1949, p. 62). A pr-
mary problem for Adome lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, sy mphonic works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records, The result was inferior to the
original, and Adorno was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile mileu
impossible” (Adamo, UU lb, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adomo, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the top the original or [dea- to down of layers of imitations; to Adamo, mans

feld. Adorne, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
