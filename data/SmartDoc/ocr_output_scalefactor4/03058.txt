. According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innavation is commu-
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
aca idea, practice or abject perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
s1on of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p, 409),
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu-
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Laswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-C-R-E
(¢.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-elfect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this S-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) Message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(3) the effects can be individual’s adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, “Time variable
is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation's rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables
that influence how and why users and audience adopt anew information medium, such as the Internet,
According to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even though in the
past the individual is usually the unil of anaiysis. Aiso, critical mass becomes an important factor in
adopting new media hecause new media are Interactive tools and thus are required by many users to
gain efficiency. That is, the mare peopie use, the more people ger benefits, Im this sense, diffusion
theory not only can apply te practical things, but alsa can be related to digital divide
There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
“/ 1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Lagaards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, Pp. 183-185). Ropers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier In adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 4), Figure | shows the relationships between TYPES
of adopters divided by innovativencss and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories
follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped. Source by wh w2.gsu.edu/ wwwitr/doc sidif-

a S-shaped curve. However, as noted above, diffe rent types of Innovations (€.g., the ae neta
