2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic Context, a5 opposed to
other writers in the Frankfurt School {Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were to
maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that contral.
Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions
(Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, it is difficult in Marcuses argument to separate culture
or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass
Media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno
had done. In the end Marcuses analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant
ideology. Marcuse wrote, “how can the administered individualswho have made their mutilation
into their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus Teproduce it on an enlarged scaleliberate
themselves from themselves as well as from their masters? Hew is it even thinkable that the
vicious circle be broken” (Marcuse, 1991, p. 251). Given the pessimistic tone of the book,
