social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, bal-
ance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology,
played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider,
Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction,
relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars
as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut, During the later part of the decade
and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Rolotf, and Berger became popular
along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson.
Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal comm research
agenda during the past two decades” (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus
on dyadic communication, communication invelving face-to-face interaction, or communication as
a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically
focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized
that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).
Since its intraduction im the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has
contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus
on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work

is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our
understanding of interpersonal processes.

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of commu-

ication, it would be beneficlal to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined

expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining eee =
the “number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave” (p. 100). The greater the
level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be ale as one
