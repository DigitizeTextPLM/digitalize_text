In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous researches on
pratificarions detected diverse gratifications that attract people on the media, they did not address the
connections between these gratifications (Katz et al., 1974a). They suggested that uses and gratifi-
cations research concern with following aspects: “(1) the social and the psychological origins ot (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) dif-
ferential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in (6) need gratification and (7) other
consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones” (Kate et al., 1974, p. 20). The studies of Kate and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the uses and gratifications approach. Since
then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The current status of uses and
sratifications is still based on Katz's first analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in
such an electronic information age when people have more options of media use,
