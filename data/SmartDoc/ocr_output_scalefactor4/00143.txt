1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
Culture industry outside of a German context. In the years since there have been numer-
ous criticisms of the text, not least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about “the
commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adomo erred in not discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, be-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton,
1991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded thal “the diffusion of dominant ‘alee ee
among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys-
fem ag a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36). Fredric Jameson pointed aut that Adam's idea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the ei:
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during ho 5.
