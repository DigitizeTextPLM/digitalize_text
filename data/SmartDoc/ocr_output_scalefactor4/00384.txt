p.13). Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the sacial dimension. The structure level

On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However,

itis considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the
shared convention, the structure.

A, language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of
language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one
wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that 1
resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought, It is because speech ig

creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-1 iF

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system inta two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a co neapt or meaning which Is Expressec throwgh le form.
The form is called the signifier, which is tha external part of language. For example, both the werd
dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dag. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becames the signified. "| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
