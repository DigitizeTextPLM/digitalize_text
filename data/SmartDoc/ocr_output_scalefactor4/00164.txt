A, language is therefore, =a social institution and a system of values. [tis the social part of
language, itis eesentialhy a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one
wishes to communicate. Itis beacause a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a socal insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization, The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speeenh is
essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual ect and not toa pure
creation. (Barthes, 1267, pe. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system inta two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which i expressed thraugh the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or im Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified, “| propose to retain the word sign feigne! to
designate the whole and to raplace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifier (significant), the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-

rates them from each oiher and from the whole of which they are parts” (Saussure, 1659, in R. Innis
fed.}, p. S¥). The correspondence of the conceptimeaning to the extemal form is notin the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. [tis not the inevitable internal relation but the differance
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (7960) argues that “language does

not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning fram
within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences’. According to Saussure, meaning
