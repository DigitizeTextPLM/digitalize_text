1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is & basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the foal of reducing uncertainty, Uncer-
faint) Reduction theory (URT), accredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J, Calabrese (1975), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty,
research. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations Underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty’ (p. 133). The study ef information is basic
to all fields of communication, but its relution to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the rele of communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication, Berger and Cal-
abrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ sociul psychological theories a starting points” io. So)

1.2 The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Traditionally, communication has been viewed as an interdisciplinary field. Interpersonal communication is
most aften ed to studies into language, social cognition, and social psy chology. Prior to the 1960s, only a
modest amount of research was completed under the label of interpersonal communication. Heath and Bryant
(2000) marked this time as the origin of the field of interpersonal communication: “Particularly since 1960,
scholars adopted communication as the central term because they wanied fo siady it asa significant and unique
aspect of human behavior" (p. 3%}. The 19605 produced research that impacted the development of an in
terperson al field. Research in psychiatry examined personality and the influence of relationships, tinding that
were not only a result of self problems, but a result of relational problems as well. Re
