4 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1872 English-language translaion marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culture indusiny auiside of a German context in the years since there have been numer-
cus erilicieams of the text, not least since Adomo made sweeping generalizations about “the
commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1998, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah ook. Adorno erred in mot discudsing the processes af cul-
tural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's econcerec dependence on offer
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1958, p. 46)

For Terry Eagleton, bath Adomo and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, be-
heving that “capilalet society languishes in the gp ofan all-pervacee reification” (Eagleion,
1901. p. 46) Stil, Eagleton conoeded that “the diflusion af dominant values and belies
among appressed paogles in society has some pan io play in the reproduction of ihe sys-
jem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1981, p. 35) Fredric Jameson pointed aut that Adarnas idea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the 1860s
