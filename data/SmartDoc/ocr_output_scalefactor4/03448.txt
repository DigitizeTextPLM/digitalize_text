1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1872 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culture industry outside of a German context. In the years since there have been numer-
ous criticisms of the text, not least since Adomoa made sweeping generalizations about “the
commedified and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996, p. 173). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adomo erred in not discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, be-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagheton,
1991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded thal “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the Sys-
tem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adono's idea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the 1960s
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 13408.
While the idea of the culture Industry can be defended as a useful theery for industrial soci-
eties between 1920 and 1970, trying to us¢ it today weakens IS effectiveness {Hohendahl,
4995, p. 146-48). Thus, fora some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry would
appear to be marely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value at all.

Thus for some critics modernist works wolbd be counteracting forces against the dominant
ideology. As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may De pM WEL
