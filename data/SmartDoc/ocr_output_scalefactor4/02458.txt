Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the develapment of communication theory. Information exchange is a baste human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Umcer-
tainty Reduction theory (LRT), accredited to Charles R. Bergerand Richard J, Calabrese (1975), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development of LRT, these aclvolars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning inlenperconal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 153}, The study of information is basic
to all fields of communication, but its relatian to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the rale of conumunication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication, Berger and Cal-
abrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the imerpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories as starting points” (p. 5).
The research underlying the theory and efforts made by ober contemporaries marked the emergence of iinter-
personal communication research: with the development of URT, communication researchers began to laok to
eommunication for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social
sciences.

1.2 The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Traditionally, communication has been viewed as an interdisciplinary field. Interpersonal communication is.
most often linked te studics inte language, 2oclal cognition, and sacial peychology. Prior to the 1940s, only a
modest amount of research was completed under the label of interpersonal comAunication, Heath and Bryarit
(200) marked this time a the origin of the fell of interpersonal cartimiunicaticn: “Borticularly since 1964,
scholars adopeed communication as the central term because they wanrtet fa steely ri ae a eleniogar and wnigue

terpersontal field. Research in psychiatry examined personality and the influence of relationships, fineling that
