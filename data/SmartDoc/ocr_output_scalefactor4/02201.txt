1 DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion,
social influence, and small graup processes, Theories explored che role of learning, dissonance, bal-
ance, social podgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Rurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology,
played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Header,
Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction,
relational development, and relational conerol, This was influenced by the research of such scholars
as Knapp, Metvabian, Aleman, Taylee, Duck, Kelley, and Thihaut. During the later part of the decade
and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches af Hewes, Planalp, Raloff, and Berger became papular
along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson.
Berger (2005) states: “these early theocetical forays helped shape the interpersonal comm research
agenda during the past two decades” (p. 416). Today, inmerpersonal communication tends to focus
on dwadic communication, communication invalving face-tu-lace inleractean, of communication as
a Function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically
focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolutan of relationships [1 has been recogmined
that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calatrese, 175).
Since its introduction in the 197s, uncertainty has been recognized 2s a major field af snedy chan has

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified a6 an important construct, necessary to the study of commu-
nicacion, i would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined
and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through ihe theoretical framework of informatian
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed ina given situation when there
wat a high amount of peesible alternatives and che probability of cheir evens was relatively eqaaal.
Shannon aml Weaver relied this view of uncertainty to the cransmission of messages, but their work
also contributed in the development of UAT. Berger and Caladrese (1975) adapted Tomcepts fron the
informacion thearise as well as Heider (1958) research in amribeeion, Berger and Calatress (1975)
‘panded the concept of uncenainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertaleay as
the “number of altemative ways im which each interactane Tight behave (p. 1007 The Breater che
level of uncertainty that exists ina situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to pre:

Predicting present and past behaviors, but alsa explaining why pariners behave on believe in the w
that they do. Berger and Bradac's (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the conplexi chet
