Baferent media. MeQuail, Blumler. and Brown (1972) proposed a model of "media persan
Interactions” to class fy four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape fram routine or
problems; Emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship: social utility; (3) Personal
identity: self refe rence; reality exploration; value reinforces: and (4) Surveillance [forms of infarma-
tion seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audie nce’s motivation was suggested by McGu re (1974), based
On a general theory of human needs. He disti nguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective, Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” yersus
“Internal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation [MeGuire, 1974), Katz, Gurevitch and Haas
(1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understandin gE:
2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;

3. Personal integratve needs, including credibility stability, status;

4. Socal integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends; and

5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Congruously, McQuail’s (1983) classification of the fallawing common reasons for media use:
