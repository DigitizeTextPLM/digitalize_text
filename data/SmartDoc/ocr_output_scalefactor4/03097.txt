were published without their permission in 1049, Horkheimer and Aderne protested, capers
themselves from their awn work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the ate
1940s the Institute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises in 1951, Horkheimer
became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954 Adorno published an essay
entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of a study that had been done for the
Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner and others. In this essay Adorno
warned, rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a meediurn af undreamed
of psychological control (Adorno, 200La, p. 160). Tt was one of the few occasions in the 1950s
that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture, At least one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments
of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt bo reshape
his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal psendo-culture
in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1964 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1968, when writing the esay Transparencies on Film,
Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Holendahl, 1995, p. 131).

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to
other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 600). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 3000, p. 144), Capitalist
preduction and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affuence that kept elements of society satisGed and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were to
maintain sockal control and continue to perpetuate the ideclagy that maintained that control.
Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and enierbainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination funetions
(Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, it is difficult im Marcuses ATEUMent to separate culture
or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass
media a8 #ntities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorna
had dope. In the end Mancuses analysis of society allowed for oo opposition te the domi t
