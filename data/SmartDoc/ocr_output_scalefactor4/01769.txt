As Lippmann was ‘weiling, propaganda. Harold Lesswell was undertaking empirical analres of propagamida. In
fect. mech of the propaganda that Lawiwell was examinieg at octoally being writoes by Lippmann himeell
(Ringers, 11),

Harold Lasewell (1900-1971) was a prominest scholar in die area of propaganda newearch. He focused en
condacting both quanticative amd qualitative anahrus of propaganda, understanding the cosieat of propaganda,
and disomrering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 104). Laswwell is credited with creating
ihe fet Communication procedure od coment analysis (Hoge, 1H). Gesewally, conpent analysis can be
defieed as, ° the vestigation of communication messages by categorizing Message Come ine elon iicutieprrs
In onder 00 Mine Ceram variables” (Rogers, 14) In an aay enticed “Lonients ef Communication,”
Laswell (1945) explains that a content analysis should wake into account the frequency with which cenain
symbols appear in a mariage, dar direction ie which the syaibols ory oo pervade the aadience’s opinion, and
ihe intensity of the symbol used. By undersianding the coment of che message, Lasewell (1540) aims te
achieve the goal of onderstanding the “stream of influence that runs from control eo coment and from conient
to audience” fp. 74

This method of content analysts is tied strongly to Lawewell (0950) early delinition of communication which
stated, “Who sine what in which channel to whom and with what effects” (p. 24). Conoent analysis was easen-
cally dhe sage what pari od chia definilion, and Laswell weer on to doa lot of work wahin the aera during dhe
remainder of hid caneer.

Aside from understanding hi conicnt of propaganda, Lasswell was aloo ineresied im how propaganda could
shape public opision. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media, Laswell wack particularly
interested in @xamining dhe effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In dis
wey, Laseeell has created a eyele, whereby the public is limied in che information that i presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accep i. However, i is soll then information that i affecting dwar decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presemied bochem by the gowernment, Thr is an inenstmg way of viewing
dhe power of the eedia thal is somewhat similar oo Lappmane’s theories,

12) Edward Bernays (1890-1995)

AQ approsimately the same time that Lipprane and Laewall were examining poblic opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bemays (1526)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, endoring effort tn create or shape events oo influence the relations of a
peblic wo an enterprise. idea, or group (p. 25). Contrary to other propaganda thins, Berays recognines
dhal propaganda can be either beneficial or harmvtol oo che public. [et can help inalividheils Gocide wien 10 thik
abet or alter the opinions of individuals, beat this may actually be beneficial to society's functioning as a whole,
Bemays sales, “We get govemed, our minds an: moldind, our tastes dormed, our ideas suggested. largely by
mee we have never beard of... Wast numbers of human beings mow cooperrav in this manner if they are in five
together as a smoothly functioning society (fp. 3).

Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be auodifled, and that such shaping & a necessary pan of
society, Hemays pursued his week in the field of peblic relations. “Public relations is the arempt, by information,

and adjusement, in engineer problic suppor for an activity, cause, movement, or institivtion’ (Hemays,

1965, p E). de the Engineering of Consent, Bermays (0055) hays ourthe frameword for enderstanding oe public

Bemays' theories represent a step forward for mass communication theory, They move aeay from more
typical presentations of *hitor-miss propaganda,” and move toward a deeper
