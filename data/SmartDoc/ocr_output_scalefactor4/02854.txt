CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

til the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in MMAuercltiE

Understanding of the public, a
public opinion (Gernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase,
the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning And it is careful planning more
than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from ald-time hit or miss publicity and
propa aT {Bern VE, 1655. p a) Furthermore, Bernayes theories alsa represent Fe different Wiew of
the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as bemg easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is mot an amorphous mass which
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea
that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p- GG).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather thas merely attempting to
manipulate the public through pa nda, Bernave presents public relations as a tool that
1

bo combine the ideas of the public and the persmader. The objective-mi led public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to rt {Bernays,
1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of

i but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in gener al, public relations 1s important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpolnt of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade or suggest courses of action (p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is etill possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such aa

Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theores developed oy and Bernoys are important for a number of

reasons, Based on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann was able to bring attention to the fact that
the public is able to be influenced by the media. The wark of Lippmann aml fas colleagues has ted fo more
recent research thef is meant fo help understand the influence of the media on the pudiic. Through the
work fyenqar and Kinder, White, Lewin, and McCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensive unde rstanaing
of the media Aas been developed. The public has now been made qware fariois media functions such as
agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming, wid the potential effects that these tecnnigues con have on

Heir audiences

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the direct effects ancl] limited effects
media models. Theorists such as Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
propaganda exmall di

rectly influence the thought of the masees. Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippmann
also noted that the media might not be influencing only thought, but may also be influencing what
people thought about. It was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting point for future research
in the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work of
yengar and Kinder, as well as WicCombs and Shaw. Overall, the research of the scholars diseussed in

this paper has been very important to the understanding of the media, the manipulation of the public,

and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul

were formed years ago, they continue to help us understand the society that surrounds us today
