one “tasteless demonstration” in which three females bared iheir breasis. Adorno died a few
months later (Jager, 2004, p. 207-08).

1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1872 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the Mea of the
culture industry qutside of a German contend, In the years since there have been nurmer-
ous criliciams of the text, not least since Adora made pweeging ganeralizaions about “the
commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Ceborah Cook, Adore erred in not discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and failed ta examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (oom, 1955, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Aderna and Marcuse cvarestimated the dominant ideclogy, be-
living that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reificalion” (Eagleton,
1504, p. 46). Stil, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and bealignts.
among oppressed peapies in saciety has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys-
tam as a whole” (Eagleton, 1981, p. 36). Fredne Jameson pointed out that Adome's ea
of a culture industry was historically irniled, since the society that develaped in the 19605
and 1970s with new media went beyord the cultural possibilities available during the 14s.
While the idea of the cuflure mdusiry can be delerded a6 a usetul theory for indusbial saci-
elies bebween 1620 and 1970, Irving to use it today weakens ils effectiveness (Hahendahil,
1996, p. 146-48). Thus, for a some critic, tne value of the idea of the cullure indusiry would
appear io be mercy historical, if they in fact comeeded thal it had any wah at all.

Thus for some critica modemisl works would be counteracting forces agains! the dominant
ideology. As noted in the example of Oreon Vvelles, however, fimay be the case that the
dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for iis own ards. The idea of the culture
induatry has had an enportance in critical theory since itp appearance in the 19405, in that
it has led bo thought about the role of mass communications in relation to ideology. and
hence, society. Since Adana made aweaping generalizations about the impact ofthe culture
industry, and since he did not syslematically explore how tne culture industry operated, it has
been generally easy for some bo demise the dea of a culbure inedupiry. [is nonetnedess ie

A reexamination of the idea of the cufure indusiry may be necassary in order io theorize on
how mass communication mack propagale dominant ideologies
