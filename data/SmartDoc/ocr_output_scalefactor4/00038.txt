included Frits Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Bisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Dablin, and
Bertolt Brecht, several of which found work in the Hollywood movie industry. The foct that Adorno

These preconditionsAdornas interest in music, his friendalilp with Benjamin, and his work on the

his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adora, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present iteelf as art. They were instead
a business, and this in tarm hecame an ideolagy to legitimize the trash they intentionally preduce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 16). This business was based on what Adarne referred to as Pordist
capitalism, in which mass prodwctlon based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar ai these tendencies were based on centralisation and hierarchy ([Hobendabl,
1995, p. 142). Examples of thisnet specified by Adormmowere the Hollkwood production system, or
the CHS radia network that had been sesociated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit BOngS were based on fromulas, and the formula eupplantea the work (Horkheimer ancl Adorno,
202, p. 84). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the systero,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p.
106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles
a8 an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would
allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it ite own, ultimatel, dering :

(Friedman , 1081, p. 16). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
of social control (Horkheimer and Adore, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of cokes
