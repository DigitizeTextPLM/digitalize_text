Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was redincovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu katz ib one af the mast well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach,

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and a5 a communication researcher, He recelwed his PhD. in Sa-
ciology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Gavernment of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience Ind to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s to19906 [UPENN, 2001). In
1997, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg Schoal at the Liniversity of Pennsy/vans and abso directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Katz's mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, who is one ofthe pioneers of gratificatians research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concep of gratifications with the
functional theory madel. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the

nation that people use the media to their benefit. In 8 study by katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject
