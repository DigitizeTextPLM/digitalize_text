Lika many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural linguistics.
To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation
by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole, Langue is the systernatized set
of conventions necessary to cormunication, indifferent to the maternal of the signal which compose
it, as opposed to it, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language" (Barthes, 1967,
#13). Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the gocial dimension. The structure level,
langue, is the social convention or value shared through a society which Is stabilized and standardized.
On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level, However,
itis considered relatively flexible due to the fact hat speech by an individual cannot be free from the
shared convention, the structure.

4 language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of
lanquage, itis essentially a collective contract which one must acoept In its entirety if one
wishes te communicate. itis because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications caming from a single individual and is consequently 8 social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
ar individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought It is because speech Is
essentially a combinative activity that it comesponds to and individual act and mot to a pure
creation, (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system inte two parte, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the fori.
The form i called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the extemal forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signifiad. “| propose to retain ihe ward sign (signe) te
designate the whole and te replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advaniage of indicating the opposition that $epa-
rates them fram @ach other and from the whole of which they are paris" (Saussure, 71859, in RF. Innis
fed.), p. 37). The correspondence of the conceptimeaning to the extemal fonm is not in the destined
relation. but rather, in the arbitrary relation. Itis not the inevitable internal relation but the difference
between ihe signs that operates the signifying system, Saussure (150) argues that “language does
not reflect a pre-existent and extemal reality of independent objects, but consiructs meaning from
within iteelf through a aeries of conceptual and phonic differences". According to Saussure, “meaning
ig produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic
fe.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (@.g., synonyms), organized into @ signifying system” (Barker,

2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
game paradigmatic, the selection ls also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members, For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the follow-
ing sentence: “| went to a theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence is established through the
linear combination of signs, The signs within the example, such as | theater, my, and girlfriend can be
substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as "She went to a restaurant with heer rreother,”
Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated only when
they are related to each other. “Crucially, signs do not make sense by virtue of reference to entities in
an independant object word; rather, they generate meaning by reference to each other. Thus, mean-
ing is understood a$ a social convention arganized through the relations between signa” (Barker, ©.,
2002, p. 29). “Itis central to Saussures argument that red is meaningful in relation to the difference
between red, green, amber etc. These signs are then organized inte a sequence which generates
meaning through the cultural conventions of their usage within @ particular contest.
