Acoraciner to — (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation 15 ss ei
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social elaine sir ee
is am iclea., practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. T he di -
sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 07).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass COMMU
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful, Lasswel
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-C-R-E
(e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this S-M-C “B-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can bet
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variable
is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables
that influence how and why users and audience adopt a new information medium, such as the Internet.
lecording to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even (hougn in the
past the individual is usually the unit of analysis. Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in
adopting new aigdia because new Aredia are interactive fools and thus are required by many users to
gain efficiency, That is, the mare people use, the more people get benefits. In this sense, diffusion
fheory not only can apply fo practical things, but also can be related to digital divide.
Phere are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
“(1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Lute Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” ( Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure | shows the relation ships between types
