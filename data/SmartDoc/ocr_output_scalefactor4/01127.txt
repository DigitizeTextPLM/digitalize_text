I, DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research comducted under the title of imerpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion,
social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the rale of learning, dissonance, bal-
ance, :oClal judgment, ated reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology,
played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider,
Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction,
relaticnal development, and relational commol This waa influenced by the research of such scholars
a5 Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During che later part of the decade
and into the 1380s, the cognitive apptoaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, amd Berger became popular
along with research into behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgean, and Patterson
Berger (2005) states: “these theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal comm research

agenda ducing the past hea e’(p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication tends tn fons

a function of developing relationships. Research into imerpersonal communication theory typically

that interpersonal comominication is motivated by uncertainty redwction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since amcenainty has been identified a6 an important consinect, mecessary fo the stacy of commu.
nication, it would be beneficial io know when the concept originated, and how ir has been defined
and studied, One way & ide aacertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1549) proposed that uncertainty existed im a given situation when there
was a high amount of posible alpernatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this etew of uncertainty to the ramaniision of messages, bur their work
also coneritinied so the developmess of WET. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopoed concepts from the
information theorists a8 well as Heider (1958) research in attribution. Berger and) Calabrese (1975)
expanded ihe concept of uncertainty to fit inteqpersonal comerunication by defiming umcertainry a
the “wamber of aleernatve ways im which each interactant might bel ip. LOL The greater the
level of uncertainty that exists ima situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to pre-
dict behaviors amd ocoomences. During interactor: indrviduals are not only faced with problems of
predicting present aned past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave of believe in the way
that they do, Berges and Bradac's (1982) definition of uncertainty highliphied che coenplesicy of this
process when Ulery stand: “Linceriainty, then, cam stem from the large number of altermative things
that a stranger cam believe or potentially say" Uncertainty plays a significant mle when examining
relationships. High bevels of uncertainiy can severely inhibi! relate development. Uncerininty com
