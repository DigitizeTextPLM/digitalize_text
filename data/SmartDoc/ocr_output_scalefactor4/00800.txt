1. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States bad gone far beyond anything he had seen in
Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with baa i!
in Europe. The closest thing in Adornos experience to the advertising industry in. the United tates
was fascist propaganda (Jager, 2004, p. 122}. Adore was later to allude to his SXPeTIeNce with
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Laarsfeld and Adorno did
not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adornos dissatisfaction with
the work of the Princeton Hadio Research Project would eventually metivate him to further develop
the idea of the culture industry.

Becouse of the relationship between the Institute for Social Research and Colembia Ontrerstty,
Hortheimer, who had already moved to California, could nat bring Adorno fo the West Coast until
Nowernber 250. When Adorno was finally able te relocate, be joined an expatriate conminity fot
included Frits Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hana Bialer, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Dahlin, and
Bertolt Brecht, several of witch found work in the Hollywood move industry. The fact fat Adorno

These precomlitionsAdornoe interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radia Project, as well as invelvement with the expatriate community in California and the

relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important to an understanding of
his concern for the ides of the culture industry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adore, popular caltare on film and radio did not bother to present itself az art, They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheamer and Adorno, 2002, p. 05). This business was based on what Adomo referred ta as Fordlst
tapitaliem, in which mass producthin based on the techniques used by Hency Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl
1885, p. 142), Examples of thisnot specified by Adornowere the Hollywood production Sysbem a
