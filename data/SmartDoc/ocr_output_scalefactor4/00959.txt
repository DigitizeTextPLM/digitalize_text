Rogers was bor in Carroll, lowa in 1991, He eamed his B.A,, M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from Iowa
State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly,
in 1966, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea.

; The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creats applications of diffu-
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously
mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was
suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005,

According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu-
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption, The diffu-
sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p, 409).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu-
ication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its Innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-C-R-E
(e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-cffect}. Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this §-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19), Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variable
is a very important factor, According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted fo explain the variables
that influence how and why users and audience adopt a new information medium, such af the Interest,
According to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even fhougn in the
past the individual is uswally the unit of analysis, Also, critical mass hecomes an important factor im
adopting mew media becouse mew media are interactive tools ane this are required! by many users fo
gain efficiency. Thar is, the more people wse, the more people get benefits, Jn ‘tit: sense, diffusion

fheory not only can apply te practical things, bat also can be related to digital divide.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
“(1) Innovators (venturesome}, (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (3) Laggards (traditional) (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-1 #5), Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively carlier in adopting new ideas than aise
members of his social system" (Rogers, 1995, p. 40), Figure | shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these salegories
follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped. Source by wrwrerd gated werwitr/docs! dif-

there are five stages.

|. Knowledge + or = (selective exposure or awareness Of news)

> Attitudes + or — (people have positive or negative attitude toward innovations)

3. Adoption (Decision): people decide to adopt the innevation

4, Implementation (regular or standard practice)
