Rogers was born in Carroll, lowa in 1931, He earned his B.A. M. A., and Ph.D, degrees from lowa
State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly,
in 1966, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea.

The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creats applications of diffu-
ee theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously
mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was
suffering from kidney disease, He died on October 21, 2005,

According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu-
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409),
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu-

nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell

(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, 5-M-C-R-F

(e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1993) mentioned, “this S-M-C-R-F commu-

nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender

can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally

(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, “Time” variable

is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)

the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-

vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables
that influence how and why users and audience adopt a new information medium, such as the Internet.

According to evalution of media technolagy, interpersonal influences are important even thowgh in ite

past the individual is usually the unit of analysts, Also, critical mass becontes an important factor in

adopting new media because new media are interactive fools ane tus are required by many users fe
gain efficiency. That is, the more people use, the more peaple get benefits. int this sense, diffusion
theory not only can apply to practical things, but also can he related to digital divide.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
“(1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority Cee ae
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185). Rogers ae
thig term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure 1 shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these ie
follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped. Source by Soe ee a
fusion’ Figure 2 show's that an innovation would spread through society over various pe : £0 es a

haped curve. However, as noted above, different types of innovahions (e.g., the rate 0! tetracyeu
=e ick that of the hybrid seed corn) can have their own different rates in diffusion. Fig-

cept'o2 html When it comes to the process of innovation-decisions, Rogers (1995) mentioned that

there are five stages.

1. Knowledge + or — (selective exposure of awareness Of mews)

Attitudes + or = (people have positive or negative attitude toward innovations)

3, Adoption (Decision): people decide to adopt the innovation
4, Implementation (regular or standard practice}
