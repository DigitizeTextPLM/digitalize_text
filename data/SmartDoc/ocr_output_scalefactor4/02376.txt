The book has become the standard texthook on diffusion theory and it crests applications of diffu-
gion theory in gach fells as geography, economics, paychology, political scierie, and, as previosly
mentioned, communication, Rogers retined from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was
suffering from kidney disease. He died on Ctober 21, BO. ;
According to B (1G), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation 1 commu-
nicated through j Je over time among the members of a social system. An Innewaticn
is an Wea, pract of object perceived as new by an individual of ceher unit of adoption. The diffu
som of insewations invelves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).
‘That is, by shariyg communication channels such a3 interpersonal communication OF mass GOMeM-
fication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innervation as useful. Lasswell
(1446) presented a welltonnwn model of coenmunication that ip analyzed as five parts, 5-M-C-R-E
(e.g., sender-message-channel-recerver-elfect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this $-M-C-R-E comim-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffision” (p. 19}. Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or op leaders, (7) message can be o new idea or product, (3) channels can be
imerpersonal or mais comenunication, (4) receivers can be members of a social xestem, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoptiog or social change. In the diffusion theory, “Tine” variable
