Blacifications detected diverse gratificatons that atract people om che mecha, they did not address the
comnections berween these gratilicalions (Katz et al, 197g). They soggesied that uses and grarifi-
cations research concern with following aspects: “{1) the social and the payciobogical origins of (2)
needs which generate (2) expectations of (4) the mass media oc other sources which lead oo (5) dif-
ferential exposare {or engaging in other activities), resulting im (6) need gratification and (7) other
Tonsequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones" (Kalz ef al, 1974, p. 20), The spades of Katz and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foumedation of frailding the uses and gratifications approack Since
then, the research on this subject has been soengihened and extended. The current status of wees and.
gratifications is still based an Batz's first analysis, particularly 45 new eredia forms have emerged ie
such an electronic infcemarion age when people have more opeions of media use.
