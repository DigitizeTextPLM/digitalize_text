i. OTHER PROPAGANDA, THEORISTS

1 Other Propaganda Theorists
1.1 Harold Laswell (1902-1978)

+ age ree writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda, In
OF fhe propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself
(Rogers, 1944).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of prapaganda research, He focused on
conducting both quantitative and qualisative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propapanda,
and discovering the effect of prapaganda.an the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswell is credited with creating
the Mass communication procedure of content analysis (Ropers, 1194). Generally, concent analysis can be
defined as, "...che investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classifications
in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994), In an etsay entitled “Contents of Communication,”
Lasswell (1946) explains that 4 content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) alma te
achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence that runs fram control to content and from contena
to audience" (p, 744,

This method of content analysis is tied strongly 1 Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, “Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" (p. 24), Comtent analysis was essen-
tally the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the
remainder of bis career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media, Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Laswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that bs presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it, However, it te sill char informacion that is affecting their decisions within

the dempcratic syatem, and is being presented po chem by the goveroment. This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippracn’s theories.

L2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bermnays (1991-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion, Bernays (1926)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effort to creace o¢ shape events 10 influence the relations of a
public te an enterprise, idea, or group ([p. 25). Contrary to other propaganela theorists, Bernays recognizes
that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful eo the public. tt can help individuals decide what to think
about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to society's functioning as a whole.
Bernays states, “We are governed, our minds are molded, aur tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by
men -we have never heard of... Wast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live
together as a smoothly functioning society [p. 9). mh .
Based on these ideas that the pwhlic opinion can be modified, and that such shaping is a necessary part ot

society, Bernays pursued his work in the fleld of public relations. “Public relations i he attempt, by information,
persuasion, and adjustment, teengineer public suppart for an activity, cause, MoveMeNt, OF institutian® (Bemays,
1955, p. 3). Inthe Engineering of Consent, Bernays (1955) lays out the framework for understanding the public
and developing a public relations campaign. Bernays (1955) Claims that the key ta a successhul public relations
campaign is adjustment of the campaign to the attitudes of various groups in society, gathering informaton
to effectively express an idea, and finally, wtilizing persuasion to influence the public opinion in the intended

typical presentations of “hit-or-miss propaganda," and move toward a deeper
