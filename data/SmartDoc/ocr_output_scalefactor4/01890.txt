The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radia did not bother to present itself as art They were instead
a business. and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
fHorkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). Thie business was based on what Adorno referred bo aa Fordist
capitalism, im which toass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl
1995, p. 142). Examples of thismot specified by Adormowere the Hollywood prodwetion ayetem, Or
the CBS radia network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Pesearch Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas. and the formula supplants er work {Horkheimer and Adormo
3002, p. 99). Mechanical re production ensured that there would not be any real change to the system,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the eystem would emerge (Horkheim er and Aderno, 2002, Bp.
L06-T). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, an d Adorno cited Orson Welles
