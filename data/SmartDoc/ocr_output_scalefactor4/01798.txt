In addition, Mate, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous researches on
gratifications detected diverse gracificatiors that alnract people om the media, they did not address the
connections herween these pratificalions (Karz etal, 1974a). They suggested chat uses and pratifi-
