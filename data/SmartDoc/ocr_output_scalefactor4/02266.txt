1. CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing
public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22}, Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase,
the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more
than anything else that distinguishes madern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity and
propaganda {Bernays, 1955, p22). Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent & different view of
the formation of public opinion. In apposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this, He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66), Instead, Bernaye (1928) offers the idea
that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terns the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 46).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting te
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a toal that can be
used to combine the ideas af the public and the persuader, The abjective-minded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it {Bernays,
1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmans, as he recognizes the power af
society, but still alsa claims that manipulation of the public & possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefit of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert Leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate eMforts being made by others,

and to persuade ar suggest courses of action (p. D0}. Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it is not in sach blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasewell, Elta, and Beriays are important for a nimier of
reasons. Based on the idegs of Ais predeceasare, Liopmonn wos oble fo bring attention to the fact that

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the direct effects and limited effects
media models, Theorists such as Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
propaganda could directly influence the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippmann
glen noted that the media might not be Influencing only thought, but may also be influencing what
people thought about. [Tt was this line of thinking that resulted in a tharting paivt for future research
in the area of the limited effects af the media, Such limited effects were shown through the work of
Tyengar and Minder, as well as MeCombs and Shaw, Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in
this paper bas been very important to the understanding of the media, the manipulation of the public,
and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ell
were farmed years ago, they continu: to help us understand the society that surrounds us today.
