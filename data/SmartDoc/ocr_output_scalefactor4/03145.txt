itis well accepted that communication theories have developed through the realms of psychology and so-
tiology over the past 100 years. With illumed by valuable ideas as well as exploring more untilled fields in these

two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher comceptions of understan ding media. As a sub-tradition of
media effects research, uses and gratifications approach Is suggested to be originally stemmed from a func-

tionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional theory
on communication agrees with media’s effects towards people. For example, a model often used in the the-
ory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential
effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ Information into the consciousness of the masses” (Watson & Hill 1997, p.

105}, Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1940s. After that, a shift
which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses
and pratifications approach,

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media Is almost as old as
empirical mass communication research itself (McQuail, 1983). Dating back to the 1540s, researchers banca me
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well
as daily newspaper (Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warmer & Henry, 148) etc), In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium
itself [Katz et al., 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice,
support, of occasbons for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was aloo dcovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics

af conversation and a structure to the daily routine [Berelson, 1949), For these diverse dimensions of usage
satefaction, psychologist Herzog (1544) mareed them with the tern “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 19505 till D708 when television hat grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was redGcoveréd during that era. Among

the group of scholars whe focus on uses and pratifications research, Elihu Kat? is one of the most well-knowr
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the apprdach

Evihu Katz is served beth as a sociologist and as a cormmunication researcher, He received his Ph.D. in Sa-
ciglogy In 1956 from Columbla University and began teaching at the University of Chicage until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government of Isracl, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This expenence led to hie subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication fram the 130s tolaogs (PENN, 2002). in
19972, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the Universety of Perinaylvania, and alo directed its
experimental Scholars program for postdoctoral study,

Kat's mentor i Columbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, whe is one of the pioneers of gratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theary model, Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification aparcach when he came up with the
nation that peoole uae the media to their bemefit. ina study by Kats, Gurevitch and Maas (1973), @ subject

whch 1 Known as the uses and gratitications research were explored. They viewed the mass media asa means

by which individuals annect or disconnect themselves with others and found that peaple bend the media to
their meeds mare readity than the media overpower Tham (Katz, Gurevich and Haas, 1973]

Along with colleague Jay &, Glunker, Katz published a collection of essays on gratiticatians in 1534 which
were entitled The Uses af Mass Communication, They took a mere humanistic approach te looking at media
use, They suggest that medis users feek aut a medium source that best tutills (he needs of the weer and
they have alternate choices te satisty their need, (Blumer & Kate, 1974), They alse discovered that media
eerved the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission fer both Socheey
and individuals (Blumber and Katz, 1974)
