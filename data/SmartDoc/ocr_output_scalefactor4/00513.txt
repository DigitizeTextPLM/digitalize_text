ft ie Well accepted that communication thearies have developed through the realms of psychology and sa-
ciolagy averthe past 100-years. With illumed by valuable ideas as well as exploring more untilled fields in these
two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding media, As a sub-tradition af
media effects research, uses and gratitications appraach is suggested to be originally stemmed from a func-
tionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional theory
On Communication agrees with media’s efects towards people. Far example, & madel often used in the the-
ory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential
effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information inte the consciousness of the masses” (Watson & Hill L997, p.
105), Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1940s. After that, a shift
which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses
and gratitications approach,

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people ta be attracted to certain media is almmast as old as
empirical mass communication research itself (MoCuall, 1983), Dating back to the 19405, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing diferent radio pragramimes, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well
as daily newspaper (Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc.). In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by same specific content or by the medium
itself (Katz et al, 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice,
support, or oceadions far emotional release |Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was ake discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
af conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term "gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s tll 1970s when television has growin
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is ane of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz is served both a3 @ sociologist and as a communication researcher He received his Ph.D, in So-
civlogy in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1950, invited by the Government of Israel, Katt headed the task force changed
with the intreduction of television broadcasting. This experience bed to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 190s tol9aos (UPENN, 2001), In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study,

Katz's menter in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, who one of the pioneers of gratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theory model, Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
notion that people use the media te their benefit. Ina study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject
which is kriown as the uses and gratilications research were explored. They viewed the mass media as a means
by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to
their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay 6. Blumer, Katz published a collection of essays on gratiications in 1904 which
were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication, They took a more humanistic approach te looking at media
use. They suggest that media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the user and
they have alternate choices to satisfy their need. (Blumler & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that media
served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission for both society
and individuals (Blumlor and Katz, 1974).
