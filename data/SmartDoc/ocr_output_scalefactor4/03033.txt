Adorno, 2001a, p, 160). Tt was one of the few pocasions in the 1S(s
uss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments
of the fifties (Jager, 2MM, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on cecasion attempt to reshape
his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1989 he wrote of a universal pseude-culeure
in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the exay Transparencies on Film,
Adormo conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in oppasition to
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendabl, 196, p. 131).

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as oppoded to
other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1804, p. 609). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Heite, 2000, p. 144), Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed @ systern of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent [Alway, 1505, P Ba). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose rnaiZl objectives were to
maintain social control and continue 10 perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.

Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be diderentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination pel
(Marcuse, 1991, p- 8). However, it is difficult in Marcuses argument cia
