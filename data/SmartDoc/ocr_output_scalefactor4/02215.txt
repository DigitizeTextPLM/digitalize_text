1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language transialion marked the firei neal appearance of fe idea of the
culture industry outside of a German context Inthe years since ihera hawe bean rumer-
gus criticiams of the text, not least since Adoma made sweeping] generalizations about “the
commodified and fatishized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
genetaly sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adomo erred in not digcussing ihe processes. af cule

business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1586. p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse cvefeplimaled the dominant ideckogy, be-
fieving that “capitalise! society languiches in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagieton,
1951, p. 48). Stil, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of deminant values and beliefs
among oppressed peoples in socely has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys-
tem a6 a whale” (Eagitton, 1891. p, 38). Frednc Jameson painted cut that Adorno’ idea

Thus for-some critics modemistwarks would be counieracting forces agains: the darinant

it has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation to ideology, and

industry, and since he did mot systematically explore how ihe cumure industry operated, it has
been generally easy for some jo diamiss the Wea of a culbune industry. It nonetheless te
