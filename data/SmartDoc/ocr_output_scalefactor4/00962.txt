1, CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing
public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase,
the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more
than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity and
propaganda (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent a different view of
the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea
that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 66).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays,
1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint af others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade or suggest courses of action [p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of

the public is still possible, it is not im such blatant ignorance of the public opinion, Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point,

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Lasswell, Bilal, and Bernays are important for a number af
reasona. Based on the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann was able to bring attention to the fact frat
the public i able to be influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and his colleges ae fed! to none
recent research that ia meant to help understand the influence of the media on the public. Through the
wark Iyengar and Kinder, White, Lewin, and MeCombs and Shaw, a more OHnprehensive triderstancing
af the media hos been developed. The public has now been made wore panos niedia functions such as

agenda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming, and dhe potential effects fhat these techniques con fave on
their qudtences.

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the direct effects and limited effects
toedia models, Theoriste such as Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
propaga could directly influence the thought of the massee. Meanwhile, theoriste such ae Lippmann
aleo noted that the media ight not be influencing only thought, but may also be influencing what
people thought about. It was this tine of thinking that reeulted In a starting, point for future research
in the area of the limited effecta of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work of
Tyengar and Kinder, as well as McCombs and Shaw. Overall, the research of the scholare discussed in
this paper bas been very iropertant to the woderstanding of the media, the manipulation of the public
and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasewell, Bernays, anc Ellul
were fornied years ago, they continue ta help us understand the society that surrounds us today,
