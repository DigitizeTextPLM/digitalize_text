Uses and Gratifications

4.4 Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media research. The original
conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of
certain media contents. The core question of such research is: Why do people use media
and what do they use them for? (McQuail, 1993). There exists a basic idea in this approach:
audience members know media content, and which media they can use to meet their needs.
In the mass communication process, uses and gratifications approach puts the function of
linking need gratifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience members. It
suggests that people's needs influence what media they would choose, how they use cer-
tain media and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs from other
theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as aclive media users as apposed to
passive receivers of information, In contrast to traditional media effects theories which focus
on “what media do to people” and assume audiences are homegeneaus, uses and gratifica-
tions approach is more concemed with ‘what people do with media” (Katz, 1959). It allows
audiences personal needs ta use media and responds ta the media, which determined by
their social and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates
that the media compete with other information sources for audience's need satisfaction (Katz
etal. 1974a). As traditional mass media and new media continue to provide people with a
wide range of media platforms and content, it is considered one of the most appropriate
perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be exposed to different.

The approach emphasizes audiences’ choice by assessing their reasons for using
acertain media to the disregard ofathers, as well as the various gratifications obtained
from the media, based on individual social and psychological requirements (Severin
& Tankard, 1997). Asa broader perspective among communication researches, it pro-
vides a framework for understanding the processes by which media participants seek
Information or content selectively, commensurate with their needs and Interests (Katz
et al., 1974a). Audience members then incorporate the content to fulfill their needs or
to satisty their interests (Lowery & Nabila, 7583).

4.2 Origin and History

\| accepted that communication theories have developed through the realms of psy-
aia oa Le jnlogy over the past 400 years. With illumed by valuable ideas as well as
exploring mare untilled fields in these two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher

conceptions of understanding media.
