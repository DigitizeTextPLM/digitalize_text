in 1966, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea.

The book has become the standard texthook on diffusion theary and it crests applications. of diffu-
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, paychokogy, political science, and, as previously
mentioned, communication, Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because ie was

suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005.

According ta Rogers (1995), diffusion refers to “the process by which am inmovaieon os commu
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social sysiem. An Innovate

is an idea, practiog or object peroeived as new by an individual or other nit of adaption, The diffu-
sion of novations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 405)
That is, by sharing communication channels such ineperocal coMmmunicalban of Mass come

(148) presented a welltonown model of communication thet i analyzed as five parts, 5-M-C-R-E
(eg, sinder-message-chanmecl-receiversefbect), Rogers (195) mentioned, “this $-MeC-R-£ commu:
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion" (p. 19). Specifically. (1) sender
con be inventors of opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new pdea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal of mass communication, (4) rescivers con be menibers of a sxctal system, and finally
(3) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. [If the diffiaaion theory, ‘Tene’ variable

There ore five different types of odopiers in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
“(1) Innewaioes (ventaresome) (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (3) Laggards {uoditionaly” (Rogers, 1994, pp. 163-185). Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting mew ideas than other
membert of his social syriem’ (Rogers, (5, p #0) Figure | shows Uke relationships between types
