party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch ot the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began
operating there. The Nazis rise to power not only meant that A. dome lost his job and would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jtirgen Habermas would later note, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development Of Tascist regimes Was One of the historical expe-
riences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production

of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 45)

Already in the late
19305 Adomo evidenced littl hope for mass culture, As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” 15 tn effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
“The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adon lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed ina concert ball, 53 mphonic works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the

original, and Adorno was emphatic in his comdennation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make «
impossible” (Adon, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adomo, the aura of the original artwork was the
agsential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
autherity of Platonic order from the top-the original or [dea- te down of layers of imitations; to A domo, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity, The general wititude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adorno. In 193% Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in
New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, run by Paul Lazars-
feld. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although he later cluimed that he did mot know what a “radio project” was. For his part,

Lazarsteld looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be an cxpert on music. Adoma
