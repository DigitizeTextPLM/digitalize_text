pia. Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimension. ‘The structure level
lanque, is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized and rane aciiseed
Gn the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However,
it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free fram the
shared convertion, the structure.

A language |s therefore, -a social institution and a systern of values. It is the social part of
language, itis essentially a collective contract which ane must accept in ite antinety if ome

wishes to communicate. Itis because a language is 2 system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming fram a single individual and is consequently 8 social insti-
tution. In contrast to language. which is bath institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual act and not to 8 pure
creation, (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system inte taro pears, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is. a concept or meaning which & expressed through fhe form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the extemal part of language. For axarnpla, both the ward
dog in English or in organ are ihe extemal forme expressing the actual animal dog. Hare, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. “I propose to retair the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-iMmege reepectively by signified ae and
signifier (significant), the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition . isi
