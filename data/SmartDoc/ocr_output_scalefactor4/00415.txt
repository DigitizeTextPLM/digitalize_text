1.1) Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong founedation for communication
research and the development of communication theory, Information exchange is a basic human fumetion in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Uircer=
tniny Reduction theery (LRT), acoredited to Charles BR. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1973), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central mative of communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research, Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which te reduce uncertainty” {p. 133). The study of information is basic
io all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the role af communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the fleld of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersanal
communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories as starting points” (p, 94),
The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of inter-
personal communication research; with the development of UT, communication researchers began 16 lack to
communication for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in osher social
achences.
