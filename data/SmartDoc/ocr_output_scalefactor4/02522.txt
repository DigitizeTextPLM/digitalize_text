2, Inthe mass communication process much initiative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a sirong limitation on
theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and
behavior.

_ The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction, The needs served by
mass communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs,
and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consump-
tion certainly varies.

4, Methodologically speaking. many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- ie. people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in
particular cases, or at beast to recognize them when confronted with them in an.
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

5, Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication slvould be
suspended while audience orientations are explored on thelr own terms, (ip. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous researches on
gratificarions detected diverse gratifications that attract people on the media, they did not address the
connections between these gratifications (Katz et al,, 1974a). They suggested that uses and gratifi-
catlons research concern with following aspects: “(1) the social and the psychological origins of (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) dif-
ferential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in (6) need gratitication and (7) other
consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones” (Katz etal, 1974b, p. 20). The studies of Katz and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the uses and gratifications approach. Since
ther the research on this subject has been strengthened amd extended. The current stams of uses and
pratifications is still based on Katz's first analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged i
such an electronic information age when people have more options of media use, Caer
