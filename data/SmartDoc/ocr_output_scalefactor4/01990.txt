I, NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic aseumptions were stated in a study of Kar, Blumler, and Cearevinch in 1974. a8 follows.
They prowide a framework for understanding the correlation between media and audiences:

1. The aodience is conceived as active, Le, an important part of of mass media use is
assumed io be goal oriented ... patents of media use are shaped by more or less
definite expectations of what certain kinds of conrent have wo offer the audience
imenier.

- Inthe mass communication process much initiative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with the aadience member, This places a strong limitation on
theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media consent on attitudes and
behavior.

The media compete with oaher sources of need satisfaction, The needs served by
Mass Communication constione but a segment of the wider range of human meeds,
and the degree to which they can be adequabely met throagh mass media comump-
Ton certainly varies.

Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data sapplied by individual audience members themselves- Le. people
are sufficiently sell-aware to be able pe report their inperests aind mochves in
pearticular cases, on at beast te recognize them when comfponied with them im an
intelligible and familiar verbal formelation.

. Value judgment: aboot the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while gadhenoe orientations are explored on their own berms. (p. 15-17),

In addition, Katz, Bhomler, and Gurevich also commented that, although previous researches on
Bralifications detected diverse pratifications thal attract people on the media, Chey did cece acess. the
connections berween these gratifications (Katz et al., 1974). They suggested char uses and gratifi-
cations research concer with following aspects: “(1) the social and the psychological origins of (2)
needs which penerate (3) expectations of (4) the mass oredia or other sources which lead to (5) did-
ferential exposure for engaging in ather activ Pesul ting im Ph) Nee pratithcation aed (7) other
eonsequences, perhaps mostly unineended ones” (Kacz et al., 19746. p. 20). The studies of Kare and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of buikling the ues and gralifications approach. Since
then, the research on this subject has been streegihened and extended. The correm sranis ef uses and
gralifications is sail based om Katz's first analysis, partioalar new media forms have emerged in
such an electromoc information age when people have more options of media use,

1 Needs and Cratifications

Lises and gratificaiians appecach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs af audience mem-
bers. Bhomler and Kare (1974) conchoded that different people can use the same communbcation mes-
age for very different purposes. The same medi Ml may gratily different needs for different
indivicuals. There is not only one way that people ses media. Commrarily, there are as many reasons
for using ihe media as there ape media users (Blumer fe Kate, 1974),

Basie needs, socte! simavtion, ono the individuals bockground, swch os experience, interests, and
rdecotan, affrer people's ideas ooo! whet they want from media dnd which media best meet their

for using different media, Motvenl, Alumier, and Brown (7572) proposed o made! of “mediosperson
interactions” ro classify four important meote gratificotions;
