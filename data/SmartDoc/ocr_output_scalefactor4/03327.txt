ee Lasewell (502-1578) was & prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on
pee both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda,
and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswell is credited with creating
the mass COMUMUnICation procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis can be
defined as, "...the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classificatlons
inorder to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 194). In an essay entitled "Contents of Communication,”
Lasswell (1946) explains that a combent analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (15946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that mans from control to content and from content
to audience” tp. 74).

This method of coment analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, “Who says what in which channel ta whom and with what effects" (p. 84). Content analysis was e5set-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to doa lot of wark within this area during the
remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of prapaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particulacty
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinian within a democratic ayetem. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public ts Limited in the information that is presented ee
and alse apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still that information that is affecting their hasan in
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar toe Lippmann + thearies.
