According to Rogers (156), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innewetion 1 COfmmiie

ig an idee, practice of object perceived ms new by an individdaall or other unit of adoption. The diffe

There ace five different tepes of adogiers in the diffusion process, according to Innovalivencss:

=(1) Innovators (venturescere, (2) Early Adapters (respectable), (3) Early Magarity (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical and (5) Laggards (reditionaly’ (Rogers, UHH, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined
ihis term as “the degree to which an dividual is relatively earlier im adopting new ideas than other
