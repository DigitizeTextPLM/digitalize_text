1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

ri d Gurevitch in (O74 as follows.
i i ons were stated in a study of Katz, Blumer, ar
Perna aE for understanding the correlation between media and audiences:

1. The audience is conceived as active, ie., an important part of of mass media ee
assumed to be goal oriented ... patterns of media use are shaped by more or less
definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience

member.

_ In the mass communication process much initiative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on
theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and
behavior. :

3, The media compete with ether sources of need satisfaction. ‘The needs served by
mass communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs,
and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media comsump-
tion certainly varies,

_ Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members. themselves- Le, people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in
particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms. (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gureviteh also commented that, although previous researches on
pratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people on the media, they did not address the
connections between these gratifications (Katz et al., 1974a). They suggested that uses and gratifi-
cations research concem with following aspects: “(1) the social and the psychological origins of (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) dif-
ferential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in (6) need gratification and (7) other
consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones” (Karz et al,, 1974b, p. 20). The studies of Katz and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the uses and gratificatlons approach. Since
then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The current status of uses and
gratifications is still based on Katz’s first analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in
such an electronic information age when people have more options of media use,

1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audi -
bers. Blumler amd Katz (1974) concluded that different people price the same celiac aaemaieg
sage for very different purposes. The same media content may ratify different needs for different
individuals. There is not only one way that people uses media. Contrarily, there are as many reaso
for using the media as there are media users (Blumer & Katz, 1974), : : a
ae needs, social situation, and the
fducation, affect peaple’s ideas about what they want from media and which media pi
heeds. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own matives et ar

for using different media. MeQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972)
