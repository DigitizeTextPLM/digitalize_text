1 Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry

jhe culture industry grows out of a concern with culture, ig developed through insights into ie
production of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition 10% amily to popular music, but also
movies. That this is so grows aul of a number of historical comlingencls- oe

operating there, The Nazis rise to pawer not only meant that Adomo lost his job and would eventually farce Dis
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jiineen Habermas would later note, the
fact that labor movements were co-cpted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe-
fences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the peaduction
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48)

‘Adorno was at Chefard from 1934 10 1938, where he worked on a manuscript on Hussert. He was considered
an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining his Frank=
furt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved to the United States, Already in the late
1990s Adora evidenced little bape for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adora debated mass culture, since film and radio became the bwo moat popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply t Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic exsay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 199%, p. 62), A pris
mary problem for Adomo lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed ina concert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard aver the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adomo was emphatic in his condemnation ofthe mechanical repreduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mais music and the new listening help ta make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adomo, HI01b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film

as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tled to class, to Adame, the aura of the original artwork was the
esvential of the artistic authenticity, To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
autheeity of Platonic order from the top-the original or Ideas to down of layers of imitations; to Adome, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adoma, In 1938 Max Horkhelmer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that eoabled the Inatitote to continue working i
New York, obtained o position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, ron by Paul escalate

the position, although be later claimed that he did not know what a “radio project” was For ie
