The following theorists signifi ik

uence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975)

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon F estinger studied psychology at the University of lowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin, Lewin,
Ome of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a sub-
stantial influence on the development ot interpersonal communication. After graduation, initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
(Samelson, 2000), Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin’s theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging field of in-
terpersonal communication and on the development of URT. Festinger is best known for the theories
nd Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted to

explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an indi idual. Lewin foreshadowed CDT

(West & ‘Turner, UMM). Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of arousal andl dis-
comfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look te
