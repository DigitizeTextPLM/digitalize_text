from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- Le., people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in
particular cases, or at least to recognize them when contro nted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms. (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumer, and Gurevitch also com mented that, although previous researches on
gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract peaple on the media, they did not address the
connections between these gratifications (Katz ét al., 1974a). They suggested that uses and gratifi-
cations research concern with following aspects: “(7) the social and the psychological origins of (2)

needs which generate (3) expectaions of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) dif-
