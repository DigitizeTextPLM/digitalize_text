e : ; (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication mes-
ge or very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different
individuals. There is not only one way that people uses media. Contrarily, there are a3 many reasons
for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual

's background, such as experience, interests, and
education, affect people's ideas about what th

ey want from media and which media best meet their
needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications

Tor using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person
interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or

problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal
identity: self reference; reality exploration; value rei i

nforces; and (4) Surveillance (forms of informa-
tion seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience’s motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based
on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus
“internal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure LA

(1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
