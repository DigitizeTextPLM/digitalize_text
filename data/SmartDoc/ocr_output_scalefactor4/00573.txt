_ According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu.
eae through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. Am Innovation
San idea, practice on object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu.
sion of Innovations invelves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu
nication people can get information ofan innovation and perceive its innovation as useful, Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, $-M-C.R.E
(¢.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this $-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model comesponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
Interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(3) the effects can be individual’s adoption or social change, In the diffusion theary, ‘Time’ variable
is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3} an innovation's rate of adoption, Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption, Ojffusion research has attempted to explain the variables

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovaliveness:
*(1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (3) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185), Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure | shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innovativencss and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories
follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped. Source by www? gsedu we with'docsdif-
fusion! Figure 2 shows that an innovation would spread through society over various periods of time in
a S-shaped curve. However, as noted above, different types of innovations (e.2., the rate of tetracycline
adoption is faster than that of the hybrid seed com) can have their own different rates in diffusion. Fig-

cepti02.html When it comes to the process of innovation-decisions, Rogers (1993) mentioned that
there are five: stages.

1. Knowledge + or — (selective exposure or awareness of mews)
2, Attitudes + or — (people have positive or negative attitude toward innova ices

3. Adoption (Decision): people decide to adopt the innovation

4, Implementation (regular or standard practice)

5. Confirmation (comparing and evaluating}
