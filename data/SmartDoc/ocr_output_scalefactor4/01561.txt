Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural linguistics
| To SAUSSUre, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the va alan
by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set
| af conventions necessary te communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which compose
it; as opposed to it, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language” (Barthes, 1967
p.13), Ba rthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimension, The structure lavel,
langue, is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized and sta ndardized.
On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However,

it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the
shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of
language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if ane
wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code

of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought lt is because speech is

essentially a combinative activity that tt comesponds to and individual act and not ta a pure

creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which ts the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dag, Here, the actual
animal. the concept in question, becomes the signified, "| propose to retain the ward sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified {signifié) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are paris" (Saussure, 1969, in R. Innis
fed), p. 37). The correspondence of the conceptmeaning to the external form is notin the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation but the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) arques that “language does
not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from
within itself through 4 series of conceptual and phonic differences”. According to Saussure, “meaning
is produced through a process of selectian and combination of signs along two axes, the Ey ntoATIANC
(e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (6.9. synonyms), orga nized inta a signifying system” (Barker,
2002, p. 29). Asa grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-

matic comprises 4 sentence, and the paradigmatic means afi of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. For an exam ple of the sy ntagmatic and the para digmatic, lets consider the fallow
ing sentence: “| went to a theater with my girlfriend." This sentence established through the
linear combination of signs. The signs within the exam pla, such as | theater, my, and girlfnend = Ee
