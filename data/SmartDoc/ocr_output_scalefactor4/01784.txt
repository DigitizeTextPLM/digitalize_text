Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure socket

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system ints two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept of meaning which i expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English ar in Korean are the eternal forma expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the aignified. “| propose to retain the word sign (sigma) to
designate the whole and to replace concep! are sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifer (significant), the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition ihat s2pa-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959. in R. Innis
jed.), p. 37}. The covespondence of the conceptimeaning te the external form is mot in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. tis not the inevitable internal relation but ihe differance
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that Tanguage does
not reflect a pre-exisiant and extemal reality of independent objects, but consinicts meaning from
within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic difterences". According to Saussure, “meaning
is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along hwo ames, the syntagmatic
(e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (6.9., synanyma), organized into a signifying system’ (Barker,
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the aynteg-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another, Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lots consider the follow-

ing sentence: "| went to a theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence is established thro the
linear combination of signs. The signs within ihe example, such as | theater, my, and eee
substitubed far by other signs inthe paradigmatic, such as “She wentios sete let he er sis
Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operate ae
they are related to each other, “Crucially, signs do not make sense by virtue of refere ae hen
