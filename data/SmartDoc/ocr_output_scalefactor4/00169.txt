1. OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1 Other Propaganda Theorists

1.1) Harold Lasewell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In
fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being writen by Lippmann himself
(Rogers, 1994).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on
conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda,
and discavering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 19%4). Lasswell is credited with creating,
the mass communication procedure af coment analysis (Ragers, 1994), Generally, convent analysis can be
definedas, "...the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content inte classifications
in order to measure certain varlables" (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled “Contents of Communication,”
Lasswell (1946) explains that 4 content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1546) aims to
achieve the goal af understanding the "siream of influence that rans from antral to content and from content
to audience” (p74).

This method of content analysis is tied strangly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, "Whe says what In which channel to whom and with what effects” (p. 64). Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on todo a lot of work within this area curing the
remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content af propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the infarmation that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept ft. However, it is still that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government, This is an interesting way of viewing
the pawer of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s thearies.

L2 Edward Bernays (1891-1945)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bermays (1928)
defines propaganda as, 4 consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of a
public ta am enterprise, idea, or group (p. 25). Contrary to ceher propaganda theorists, Bernays recognizes
that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public. It can help individuals decide wha to think
about oralter the opinions of imdividuals, but this may actually be beneficial to sochety’s functioning as a whole.
Bermays slates, “We are governed, aur minds are molded, our tastes formed, aur ideas suggested, largely by
men we have never heard of... Wast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live
together a4 4 smoothly functioning sackety (p. 9).

Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be modifled, and that such shaping is a necessary part of
society, Bernays pursued bis work ln the field of public relations. “Public relations is the atempt, by information,
persuasion, and adjustment, to engineer public support foran activity, cause, movement, or institution” (Bermays,
1955, p. 4). In the Engineering of Consent, Bernays (1955) Joys ot the framework for understanding the public
and developing a public relations campaign. Bernays (1955) claims that the key toa successful public relations
campaign i4 adjustment of the campaign to the attitudes of various groups in society, gathering information
to effectively express an idea, and finally, wilizing persuasion to influence the public opinion in the intended
direction,

Bernays' theories represent a step forward for mass communication theory. They move away from more
typical presentations of “hit-cr-mlss propaganda,” and move toward a deeper
