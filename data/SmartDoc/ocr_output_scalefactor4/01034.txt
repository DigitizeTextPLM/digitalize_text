He complained to the dean about the radical students in his. classes who were ie king
teaching impossible. In the winter term of 1968-69 students occu pied a number of bul ings
at the University at Frankfurt, including the Institute for Social Research. After the strike
anded, Adorno returned to teaching, but his lectures continued to be disrupted. including
one ‘tasteless demonstration" in which three females bared their breasts. Adorno died a few
months later (Jager, 2004, p, 201-08).

1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culture industry outside of a German context. In the years since there have been numer-
aus etiticisms of the text, not least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about “the
commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adarna emed in not discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, be-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton,
1981, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
among oppressed peoples in soaciehy has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys-
tem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36), Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adarna’s idea
Of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the 19605
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1940s.
While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial soci-
eties between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl
1995, p. 146-48). Thus, for a some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry would
appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value al all.

Thus for sore critics modemist works would be counteracting forces against the dominant
ideology. As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case that the
Gominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea af the Curture

industry has had an importance in critical theory since its Appearance in the 1540s. in that
it has led to thought about the role of mass commun '

hence, society. Since Adorno made sweeping generaliz

industry, and since he did not systematically explore how the culture industry operated, it has
been generally easy for some to dismiss the idea of a culture indu siry. It is nonetheless th
