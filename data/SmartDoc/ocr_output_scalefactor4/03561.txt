and gratifications approach.
the exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as
empirical rms communication research itself (McQuail, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well
as dally newspaper (Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948: etc.). In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served elther by some specific content or by the medium
itself (Katz et al., 19746). For instance, radio soap operas were found to sa tisfy their listeners with acwice,
support, or occasions for em otional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure to the daily routine [Beretson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”
Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s tll 19/Us when television has grown
