1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
eacieta. but till also claims that manipulation of the public is possible, Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
te exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade or suggest courses of action [p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as

Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.
