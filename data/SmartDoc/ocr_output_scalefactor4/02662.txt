achieve the goal af understanding the "stream of influence that cuns from eontrol to

= content and from content
to audience" (p, 74).

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" (p. 84). Content analysis was essen
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the
remainder of his career.

Aside trom understanding the content of propaganda, Laswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democrathe system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is [imited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. [his 15 an inte resting way of viewing
