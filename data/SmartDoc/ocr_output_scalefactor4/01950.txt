1.1. Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

research and the development of communication theary. Information exchange is a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Eimcer-
tainty Reduction theory (URT), accredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J, Calabrese (1975), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research. Heath and Bryant (2000) state; “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication

research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the role of communication inte the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrege (1979) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories as starting paints” (p. 99).
The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of inter-
personal communication research; with the development of URT, communication researchers began to oak to
