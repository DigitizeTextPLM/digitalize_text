At least one observer found it

strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments
of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion athempt to reshape
his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture

the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 2

Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film,
Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition ba
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 141).

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture

Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to
other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609). Instead of culture serving

ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (heitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
roduction and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system ol repressive
p. 83). The

entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose main objectives were to

affiuence that kept elements of society satished and quiescent (Allway, 1995,

maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.

Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions
(Marcuse, 1991, p. oO separate culture
nc mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass

&\). However, it is dificult in Marcuses argument

media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorna

had done. In the end Marcuses analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant

ideology. Marcuse wrote, how can the administered individualewha have made their mutilation
into their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged scaleliberate
themselves from themselves as well as from their mastersâ€™ How is it even thinkable that the
vicious circle be broken? (Marcuse, 1991, p. 251). Given the pessimistic tone of the book,
it is somewhat ironic that largely because of it he would be perceived as an icon for leftist
movements of the 1960s in the U.S. and Germany that developed an oppositional stance.
In spite of this, Marcuse maintained that he was a philosopher, and not an activist. Like others
associated with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of the idea that theory could be translated
into practice (Chambers, 2004, p. 226).

In reviewing the text in 1961, Friedrich Pollack reported to Adorno and Horkheimer that the
work required too much revision toa receive mass dissemination. The two authors continued to

negotiate with the Fischer publishing house until 1969, and may have only agreed to republish

the work since pirate copies had already been disseminated by individuals.
