1 Other Propaganda Theorists

1.1. Harold Lasewell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. In

fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmana fo

conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the Saat a ae ne

the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers. 184), Generally, content analysis can
defined as, "..the investigation of communication messages by categorizing mesiage conten! 1000 en
in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled "Contents of cam a
Lasswell (1546) explains that a coment analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbals appear in a message, the direction in which the symbals try to persuade the audience's opinion, ane.
the intensity af the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1546) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that pans from control to content and fram content
to audience" (p. 74).

This method af content analysis is ted strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" (p. 44), Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to doa lat of work within this area during the
remainder of his career.

Aside from understarnling the content of propaganda, Lasswell was alsa interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasewell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still that information that is affecting their decishons within.
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government, This ls an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media chat is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories.

12 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

Al approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bermays (1991-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion, Bermays (1928)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of a
public ta an enterprise, idea, or group fp. 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bernays recognizes
that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public. Tt can belp individuals decide what to think
about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to society's functioning as a whole

Bemays states, “We are governed, our minds ate molded, our tastes foomed, our ideas sugpestedd, largely Re

together as a smoothly functioning society (p. 9). ;
