For Adorne, popular culture on film and radio did not bother te present itself as art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
‘Horkheimer and Adernoa, 2002, p. 85). This business was based on what Adorno reterred to as Fordist
