Pils cd a Lata at the University oflowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin, Lewin,

jal influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
(Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin’s theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging field of in-
terpersonal communication and on the development of URT. Festinger is best known for the theories
of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted to
explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual, Lewin foreshadowed CDT
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). CDT allows for three
relationships to occur among cognitions: @ consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equi-
librium with each other; a dissonant celationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each

other; and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another

comfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to
feedback from others to evaluate their performance ankt abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual
