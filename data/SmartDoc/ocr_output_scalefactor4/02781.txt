Uses and Gratifications

4.1 Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media research. The original
conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of
certain media contents, The core question of such research is: Why do people use media
and what do they use them for? (MeQuail, 1983). There exists a ba sic idea in this approach:
audience members know media content, and which media they can use fo meet their needs
In the mass cornmmunication process, uses and gratifications aporoach puts the function of
linking need gratifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience members. It
suggesis that people's needs influence what media they would choose, how they use car-
tain media and what gralifications the media give them This approach differs from other
theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as acdive media Users as apposed to
passive recelvers of information. In contrast to traditianal media effects theories which focus
en what media do to people’ and assume audiences aré homogeneous, uses and gratifica-
tions approach is more consemed with “what people do with media" (Katz, 1959). It allows
audiences personal needs to use media and responds ta ihe media, which determined by
their social and paychological background, Uses and gratifications approach also postulates
inalihe media compete with other information sources for audience's need satisfaction (Katz
et al, 1974a). As tradilional mass media and new media continue to provide people with a
wide range of media platiorms and content, it is considered one of the most appropriate
perspectives far investigating why audiences chease to be exposed to different.
The approach emphasizes audiences’ choice by assessing (heir reasons for using
a certain media to the disregard of offers, as wellas the various gratiiications obtained
front the media, based on individual social and psychological requirements (Severin
& Tankard, 1997). Asa broader perspective among Communication researches, it pro-
Vides a framework for understanding the processes by witch meola participants sock
information or content selectively, commensurate with their needs and interests (Katz

etal, 197%4a). Audience members then incorporate the content te fulfill their needs or
to satisfy their intercsis (Lowery & Nabila, 1983).

4.2 Origin and History

exploring more untilled flalds in these two disciplinas, researchers elicit a series of higher
