Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the cancept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Uueer-
tointy Reduction theary (LRT), ecoredited to Charles BR. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (19754, recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development of UT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research, Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which te reduce uncertainty” {p. 133). The study of information is basic
jo all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty im particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the role of communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interperscnal
communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories as starting points’ (p, 94),
The research underlying the theary and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of inter-
personal communication research; with the development af VET, communication researchers began to look to
communication for theories of greater understanding rather than thearetical approaches founded in other social
aclemacs.
