2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed to
other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wigeershaus, 1994, p. 609). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society e oo
the wholesale integration of the individual inte mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it i med a system at repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83). ‘The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose maim objectives were to
maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.

Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions
(Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, it is dificult in Marcuses argument to separate culture
