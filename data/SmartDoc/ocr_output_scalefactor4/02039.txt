1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important c 1 eS ‘ -

and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there
was @ high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of metsages, but their work
also contributed to the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the
information theorists as well as Heider (19528) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as
the “number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 100). The greater the
level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able tw pre-
dict behaviors and occurrences. During interactions individuals are not only faced with problems of
predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or bellewe in the way
that they do. Berger and Bradac’s (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this
process when they stated: “Lincertainty, then, can stem from the large number of alternative things
that a stranger can believe or potentially say” Uncertainty plays a significant role when examining
relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit Telational development. Uncertainty can
cause stress and anxiety which can lead to low levels of communicator competence (West & Turner,
2000). Incompetent communicators may not be able to develop relationships or may be too anxious
to engage in initial interactions. West and Turner (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty caused
sncreased verbal and nonverbal behavior, increased levels of intimacy, and increased liking, In inter-
actions individuals are expected to increase predictability with the goal that this will lead to the ability
to predict and explain what will occur in future interactions. When high uncertainty e5sts ae
