Uncertainty Reduction

L1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, ihe concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Uncer-
tainty Reduction theary (URT), accredited 1o Charles R. Berger and Richard J, Calabrese (1975), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship im uncertainty
research, Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning, interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 153}, The stady of information is basle
ta all fields of communication, but tis relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the role of communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empitical rscarch on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories as starting points” ip. 99).
The research underlying the theary ard efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of inter-
personal communication research; with the development of LRT, communication researchers. began to hook to
communication for theovies of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social
acionces,

1.2. The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Traditionally, communication has been viewed as an interdisciplinary field Interpersonal communication is
mast often linked to studies into language, social cognition, and social psychology, Prior to the 160s, only a
modest amount of rescarch was completed under the label of interpersonal communication. Heath and Bryant
(2000) marked this time as the origin of the field of interpersonal communication: “Particularly since 1960,
scholars adapted communication as the central term because they waned fo sfuely it os a sigeificant and anigne
ayeect of human behawiar™ fp. 39). The 1960s produced research thot impacted the development of an in-
terpersonal field. Research in psychiatry examined personality and the influence of relationships, finding thas
psychiatric problems were mod only a result of self problems, bat a result of relational problems as well. Re-
search trends in humanistic psychology and existentialism inspired the idea that relationships could be improved
