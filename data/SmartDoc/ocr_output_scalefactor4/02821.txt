THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far bevond t h i
Europe, Further, the prevalence af advertising in the United States was poems SP pres 5
in Europe. The closest thing in Acarnas experience to the advertising industry in the United States
was fascist propaganda (Jager, 2004, p. 122). Adarno was later to allude to his experience with
the Princeton Ftadio Research Project in the eabay on the culture industry by noting the statietical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw thla research as being indistinguishable from political
Propaganda (Horkhelmer and Adarna. 2102, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adamo did
not agres on the value af empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adornos dissatisfaction with
the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develo
the iden of the culture industry,

Becouse of the relationahip bedeeen the fnstitute for Social Research and Columbia University,
Horkieimer, who Aad already moved to California, coud not bring Adorno to the Weat Conat until
November 1941, When Adorno ons finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate comunity Phat
tnchided Frits Long, Arnold Schoenberg, Hons Fister, Thomas and Meinrich idan, Alfred Daihin, and
Herta Brecht, several of which found work in fhe Molliywosd movie industry, The fact that Adora
was port af thas infellectual community whose members were ineoleed in the Production of Nollywand
movies must have hod some influence in developing his thonphte an culture, since the Hollywood ayatern,
inhibited the creatine freedom thal many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany.

These preconditionsAdornoas interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the

Princeton Radio Project, as well as invelvement with the expatriate community in California and the

relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all impartant to an understarding af
his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother ta present itself as art. They were instead
4 business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adotno, 2002, p. 95). This busines was based on what Adorno referred ta as Fordist
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques wed by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl,
1985, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specitied by Adormowere the Hollywood production syatem, ar
the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work [Horkheimer and Adorno,
S002, p. OO). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would mot be any real change to the system,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the eystem would emerge [Horkheimer and Adormo, 2002, p.
1Mi-T). Paradaxically, any inmovation would only reatiicm the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles:
ag an example of someone whe was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would.
allow it te assume the stance af any opposition and make it its awn, ultimately rendering it ineffectual
(Friedman, 1981, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
of social control [Horkheimer and Adora, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a syatem of economic
coercion ultimately meant the freedom to be the same (Horkheimer and Adorno, 202, p. 136).
Since Adorno bad ben, in hic essays on mesic and radio, an apparent defender ot high art, The
Culture Industry has been criticized as being a defense of high art, ae opposed to popular culture.
Adorn specifically defines avant-garde art as the miversary of the culture industry [Horkheimer and
Adorno, 2002. p. 101), It was not high art that Adarno wad presenting ac an alternative to the culture
industry, but modernism, Although he provides the idea of an eee force to the culture industry,
Adorno provides ne avert Marxist analysis. Instead, fhe metes in aati, that the dominant syetem
ili acities far mass consumplion for entertainment or amuserent,
pee ae had been, in his essays on music and radio, an apparent defender of high a The
Culture Industry has been criticized as being a defense of high art, as opposed be popular wa
Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkhemer
Adorno, 2002, p. 101).
