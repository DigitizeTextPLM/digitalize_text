relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the acini of t + : =

and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Roloff, and Berger became Pope ar
alone with research into behavioral and communic ative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson.
Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal comm elu
agenda during the past two decades” (p. 416), Today, interpersonal communication tends to focus
an dyadic communication, communication involving face-to face interaction, Or communication as
a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically
focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recognized
that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).
Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major field of study that has
contributed to the development of the field of communication as a whole. This chapter strives to focus
on those theorists who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work

is crucial to the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our
understanding of interpersonal processes.

Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of commu-
nication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined
ard studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1545) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there
was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
also contributed to the development of LRT, Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the

information theorists as well as Heider (1958) research in attribution, Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as
