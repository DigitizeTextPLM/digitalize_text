1. OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1 Other Propaganda Theorists
1.1) Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harald Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses af propaganda. In
fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself
(Rogers, 1954),

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on
conducting bath quantiative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the cantent af prapagancla,
and discovering the effect of propaganda an the mass audience (Ragers, 14), Lasswell is credited with creating
the mass communication procedure af content analysis (Rogers, 194), Generally, content analysis can be
defined as, "...the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classlficathons
in Onder to meature certain variables" {Pogers, 1944). In an essay entitled “Contents af Communication,”
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in whieh the symbols ory to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the camtent of the message, Lasewell (1946) alms to
achieve the poal of understanding the “stream of influence that runs from control io cement and from coment
to audience” [p. 74).

This method of content analysis is ted strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
ated, “Who says what in which channel i whom and with what effects" (p. 4), Content analysis was essen:
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went an ta do lot of work within this area during the
remainder of his career,

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in bow propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media, Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accepe it, However, i is anil chat information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, ard is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the mecdia that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s thearles.

12 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1991-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bemays (1928)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effart to create or shape evens to influence the relations of a
public ta an enterprise, idea, or group (p. 25). Contrary to oaheer Propaganda theorists, Brrnays recognizes
that propagarsda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public. It can help pelle decide what ta think
about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to society s fincrloning 25 a whole.
Berays states, “We are governed, our minds are malded, cur tasbes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by
men we have never heard of... Vast numbers af human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to Live
‘ smoothly functioning secieny (p. 3). ; fs
St ties te that tbe aublic ppinion can be modified, and that such shaping i a necessary pant of
saciety, Berays pursued his work in the field of public relations. “Public relations is the attempt, by mnbsemsation,
persuasion, and adjustment, to engineer public support foran activity, cause, movement, ar institution (Bemays,
1955, p. a). Inthe Engineering of Gonsent, Bernays (1955) lays out the framework for understanding} Eileledill
and developing a public relations campaign. Berays (2955) claims that the key to esuccessiul public maladies
campaign is adjustment af the campaign to the attitudes of various groups in. society, watering information

direction.

Bernays' theories rep
typical presentations of “h

resent a step forward for mass communication theory. They move away from more
it-or-miss propaganda,” and move toward a deeper
