for using different media. MeQuail, Blumer, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “redia-perion
interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or
fat she, emiational release; (2)] Personal relationships: campareonship; social wrility: (3) Personal
identity: se reference: reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance (onme of indonma
fon seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was sugpevied by MeGuine (1574), based
ona general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two lypes of needs: cognitiee and
aMeective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initaton, “extennal” wersus
“internal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of mobvations which apply to media use [Figure 1), Figure 1A
structuring of 16 gereral paradigms of human motivation [MeGuire, 1974). Katz, Gureviteh and bias
(1974) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass eredia anc
gut them into five categories:

1. Cognitive need ncluding acquiring information, knowledge and understanding:
