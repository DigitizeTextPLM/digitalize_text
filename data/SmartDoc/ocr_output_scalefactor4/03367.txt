| 1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-

abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists
Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information hos been a strong foundation for COmmumication
eory. Information exchange is a basic human function in

research and the development of communication th
formation with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Umeer-

which individuals request, provide, and exchange in
tainty Redvcrion theory (URT), accredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard J, Calabrese (1975), recogmized that

reducing uncertainty was central motive ofcommunication. Through the development of URT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in ustcertainty
research, Heath and Bryant (2000) state; “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 183}. The study of information is basic
te all flelds of communication, but its relation to the atudy of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication, WRT places the rote of communication into the orntral
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication, Berger and Cal-
| abrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
| communication prooess, they have tended to employ social paychological theories as starting points” (p. 99).

The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence af inter-
personal communication research: with the development of URT, communication researchers began to look to
| communication for theories of greater understanding mther than theoretical approaches founded in other social
Schences.

1.2 The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

modest ammvunt of research waa completed wider the label of Interpersonal communication. Heath and B: :
(2000) marked this time as the oripin of the field of interpersonal communication: “Barticularty Since a
