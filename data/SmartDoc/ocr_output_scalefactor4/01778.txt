it is well accepted that communication theories have developed through the realms af psychology and sa-
cology over the past 100 years. With illumed by valuable ideas as well as exploring more untilled fields in these
two disciplines, researchers elicit a serves of higher conceptions of understanding media. As a sub-tradition of
media effects research, uses and gratifications approach is suggested to be originally stemmed from a func-
tionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumler & Katz, 1974]. Te some extent, however, functional theory
on communication agrees with media's effects towards people, For example, a model often used in the the-
ory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential
effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information into the consciousness of the masses" (Watson & Hill 1597, p.
105}. Functional theory influenced studies on communication fron the 19205 to the 19405, After that, a shift
which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses
and gratiications approach,

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as abd as
empirical mass communication research itself (McCuail, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio prograrmmes, such as soap operas and quizzes, a5 well
as daily newspaper (Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc}, In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium

Itself (Katz et al., 19746). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisty their listeners with advice,
7 support, of eccasions for emotional release (Hereog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was alse discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratfications.”

Lees and gratiications apordach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
up. Some badic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars whe focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz 6 served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. an S0-
clology in 1956 from Columbla University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the mext thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s tol gots (PENN, 2001), In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Kate's mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, whois one ofthe pooneers of gratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced impartant outgrowths that connect the concept of gratfications with the
functional theory model, Later, Katz introduced uses and gratiiication approach when he carne up with the

pation that people use the media to their benefit. Ina study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject
vehich is known as the uses and gratifications research were explored. They viewed the mass media as a means
by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media ta
their needs more readily than the media oveqpawer them [Katz, Gureviteh and Haas, 1973),

Along with colleague Jay G. Blumler, Katz published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 which
were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication. They took a more humanistic approach te looking at media
Use. They suggest that media wiers seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the user and
they have alternate choices to saticly their need. (Blumler & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that media
served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission for both society

and individuals (Blumer and Katz, 1974].
