OUS criticisms of the text, nat least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about ‘the
commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996, p. 113), For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adora erred in not discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, be-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton,
1991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys-
tem a6 a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adorna’s dea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the socely that developed in the 19605
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1540s.
VWwhile the idea of the culture industry can be defended a3 a useful theory for industrial soc
eties between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness [Hohendahl,
1995, p. 146-48), Thus, for a some critics, the value of the dea of the culture industry would
appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value at all,

Thus for some critics modernist works would be counteracting forces against the dominant
ideology. As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case that the
dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of the culture
industry has had an importance in critical theory since its appearance in the 1840s, in that
it has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation to ideology, and
hence, society, Since Adomo made sweeping generalizations about the impact of the ee
