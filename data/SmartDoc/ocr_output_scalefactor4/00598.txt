Rogers was born in Carroll, lowa in 1931, He earned his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from lowa
State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly,
in 1966, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea,

The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creats applications of diffu-
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously
mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was
suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005,

According to Rogers (196), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is CoMm@M9-
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful, Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, 5-M-C-R-E
(e.¢., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1993) me ntioned, “this §-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea of product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally

(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, “Time” variable
is a very important factor, According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variahles
that influence how and why users and audience adopt a new information medium, such as the Internet.
According to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even though in the
post the individual ix usually the unit af analysis. Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in
adopting new media because new media are interactive toors and thus are required by many users to

gain efficiency. That is, the more people use, the more people get benefits. In this sense, diffusion

theary not only can apply ta practical things, but alse can be related to digital divide

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:

“1) Innovators fventuresome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Maj ority (Deliberate), (4)

Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Lageards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1993, pp. 183-183). Rogers defined

this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other

members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure | shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories
follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped, Source by www2.gsu.eduwwwitr/docs/dif-
fusion’ Figure 2 shows that an innovation would spread through society over various periods of time in
a 8-shaped curve. However, as noted above, different types of innovations (¢.g., the rate of tetracycline
adoption is faster than that of the hybrid seed com) can have their own different rates in diffusion. Fig-

there are five stages.
