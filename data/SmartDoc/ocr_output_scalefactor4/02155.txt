Five basic assumprions were stated in a study of Kate, Bbumiler, and Gurevitch is J

1, The audience is conceived as active, i.p., an important part of of mass media use is
assumed 0 be goal oriented ,.. patterns of media use are shaped by more or lees

mar expectations of what certain kinds of content have in offer the audience
meniter.

2 Inthe mass coomunication process much initiative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with ihe audience member. This places a strong limitation on

theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media coment on attitudes and
