of psychological control (Adorno, 2001a, p. 160). It was one of the few occasions in the 1950s
that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture, At least one observer found it
strange Vhat the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in eultural developments
of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p- 191). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape
his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture
in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1964 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies om Film,
Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 131).

production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a systertl of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1955, Bp 83). The
entirety of society had become organized arotnd an ideology whose main objectives were Fs
raintain gocial control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.
