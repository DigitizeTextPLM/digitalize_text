media effects research, uses and pratifi

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as
empirical mass communication research itself (MeQuail, 1983}. Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio DOG MMMes, such a5 soap operas and quizzes, as wel
as daily newspaper (Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc.). In these
STUGiGSs, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium
itself (Katz et al., 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice,
SUpport, oF occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure to the daihy routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1544) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1550s till 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greath to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz ls served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in So
ciology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. ln the late 1560, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force changed
with the introduction of television broadéasting, This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s to1990s (UPENN, 2001). In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg 5c hool at the University of Pennsylvania, and aleo directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctora study.
