bers. Burner aed Kate (1974) concluded that different people can uve the dane COMMUNICA mes-
fame for wary different purposes. The same media content may gretify different needs for aiterens
dividuals, There is not onby ane way thal people uses media. Cortrarily, there are a3 many reasons
for using the resmdia as there ane media users (Blumler & Rake, 1974).
