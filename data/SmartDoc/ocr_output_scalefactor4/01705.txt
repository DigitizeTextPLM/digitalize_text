Poncered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research. Heath and Bryant (20009 state: “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce unce rainty” tp. 133). The study of information is basic
to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of une erlainty im particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the role of communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal
abrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories as starting points” (p, 99).
The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of inter-
personal communication research; with the development of URT, communication researchers began to look to
communication for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social

sciences.
