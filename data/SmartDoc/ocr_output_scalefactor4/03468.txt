and studied. Gne way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory, Shannon and Weaver (1999) proposed thal uncertainty €iste! ia piven sibeation when there
was a high amount of possible aliermatiwes amd the probability of their event was pelatively expaal.
Shannon and ‘Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, bur their work
also contributed to the development of WAT. Berger and (Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the
