Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-

abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept af information has been a strong foundation for eommunicatlon

research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a basic human function in

which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing, uneertainty, Creer

tainty Reduction theory (URT}, accredited to Charles R, Berger and Richard J, Calabrese (1975), recognized that

reducing uncertainty was central motive of communication. Through the development of UBT, these scholars

pioneered the field of interpersonal communicator by examining this significant relationship in uncertainhy

research, Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning interpersenal communication

is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 183}. The study of information is basic
to all flelds of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication, URT places the role of communication inte the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communicalion process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories as siarting points” (p. 99).
The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence af inter-
persoeal communication research; with the development of URT, communication restarchers began to look to
communication for theories of greater understanding mther than theoretical approaches founded in other social
sciences.
