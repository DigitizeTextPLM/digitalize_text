1, CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding af the public, and the necessity of attention-penerating propaganda ia influencing
public opinion (Hernays, 1955, p.22), Bernays (1955) himself made a statement pe i ae
the engineering of consent, He said, Engineering implies planning. fina it is careful sa ie
than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit ae nets f
propaganda (Bernays, 1955, p.22), Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent a srs
the formation of public pinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being rer
manipulated, Bernays cautions agalnst this, He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass wi
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Pernays (1928) offers the idea
that in attempting to influence the public, a business must shidy what terms the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial, [bt must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, ta the

public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept {p. 64).
Bernays claborates om these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be:
iced to combine the ideas af the public and the persuader. The objectiveminded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it [Bernaye,
1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is aofter than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
society, but still alsa claime that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
henefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert Inadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade or suggest courses of action (p. WM). Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public be still possible, it is mot in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as
Lippanana and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

Phe theories developed by Lippmann, Losswell, Eilul, ond Bernays ore important for a number of
reason. Based on ike ideos of his predecessors, Lippmann wos able to bring attention to the fact that
