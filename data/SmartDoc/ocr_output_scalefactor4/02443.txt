1.1 Haredd Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswelll was oniberiaking empirical analyser of propaganda, bn

(Rogers. Lied).

Harrod! Laeverell (1800-LO7H) was a poominenc scholar in the area of propaganda research, He focused on
conducting both quantitative and qualiiative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propagareda,
and discowering the effect af propagandaocn the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswell is credited with coeating,
the mass communication procedue: of content asalysis (Roger, 194), Generally, coment analysis can bbe
defined ws. *_theimvestigaiion of communication messages by calegorizing musaage content into classifications

Laxewell (1546) explains then a coment analysis should take min accent the fpeqeency with which certaie
symbols appear in a missage. che direction ie which the symbol ey to pervoade the audience's opinien, and

This method of comers analysis is ded aongly io Lasewell (19%) early definition of communicadon which

dally the says whar pam od chis definition, and Lasswelll went on todo a lot of work within this area during the
remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lassall wer aleo inmercsoed in how propaganda could
shape public opieion. ‘This dealt primarily with understanding the elfeces of the media. Lasswell was particularly
imeremed in examining the effect: of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic sysiem, In this
way, Lasewell has cremed a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information chat is presenied in them,
and aleo apprehensive io accepe it. However, if is still that information that is altecting their decrons tthin

the power of the media that is somewbat similar to Lippmana’s ineories:.
