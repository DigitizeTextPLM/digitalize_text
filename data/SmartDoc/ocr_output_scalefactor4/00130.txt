Focusing on the systematic evel, Sausurre distinguishes the language system inte two
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is axprasaed through the fonn.

The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, bath the word
deg in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. “| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (sigrifié) ard
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from @ach other and from the whole of which they are parts’ (Saussure, 1859. in FL Innis
fed), p. 37). The correspondence of the conceptimeaning to the extemal form is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. | is not the inevitable intemal relation but the difference
betwaan the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (7220) argues that "language does
net reflect a preexistant and extemal reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from
within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences”. According to Saussure, “meaning
ig produced through @ process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic
fe.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g. syrenyms), organized into & aignifying system" (Barker,
2002, p. 23). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
game paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the Lead
