bers. Blumlerand Katz (1974) concluded that diferent people can use the same tlt eee
sage for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for differ

individuals. There is not only one way that people uses media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons

for using the media as there are media users (lurnler & Katz, 1974). :
Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and

education, affect people's ideas about what they want fram media and which media best meet their
needs, That is, audience members are aware of and can state thelr own motives and gratifications
for using different media. McQuail, Blumer, and Brown [1972) proposed a model of “media-persar
interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or
problems: emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal
identity: self reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance (forms of informa-

tion seeking).
Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based

ona general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “axternal’ versus
“internal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply te media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch and Haas
(1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
put therm inte five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding;

2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;

3. Personol integrative needs, including creaiblity stobillty, status;

4, Sociol integrative needs, including Interacting with family and friends; ona

§. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Congruously, McQuail’s (1983) classification of the following common reasons for media use:

wo

* seeking advice on practical matters or opinion and decision choices
