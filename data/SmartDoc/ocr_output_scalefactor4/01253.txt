Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty, acer
tainty Reduction theory (URT), accredited toCharles B. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), recognized that
TEducing Uncertainty was a central motive of communication Through the development of RT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research, Heath and Bryant (20010) state: “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 133). The study of information is basic
to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
Tesearch in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the role of communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of imterpersenal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1973) note: When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
SOnUMunication proses, they have tended to employ socal psychological theories os starting points” (pO).
The research underlying the theory arel efforts made by other contemporaries marked the envergence of inter-
personal communication research; with the development of UBT, communication researchers began to look to
communication for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical appronches founded in mher social

Sciences.

1.2 The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Traditionally, communication has been viewed as an interdisciplinary field, Interpersonal communication is
moat often Linked to studies into language, social cognition, and social psychology. Prior to the 1960s, only a
modest amount of research was completed under the label of interpersonal communication. Heath and Bryant
(2000) marked this time as the origin of the field of interpersonal communication; “Particularly sinee 1960,
scholars adopted communication as the central term because they wanted ti study if ere a saint canal wang

psychiatric problems were not only a result of self problems, but a result of relational problems HS. well. Re-
