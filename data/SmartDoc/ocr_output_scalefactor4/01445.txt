1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories preseabed ln this paper howe Ged Rewvily to both the direct effects and limited effects
wiedia models, Theorists sich ax Ellul tended to ede heevily with the direct effects model, whereby
propaganda could directly influence the thought of the masses, Mearevhile, theoriete ech aa Lappmasn
ales noted that the media might not he imffeencing only thought, but may also be influencing what
people theight abowt. It was thie line of thinking thet resulted in a sterling poise for futur research
in the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown throogh the work of
lvengar and Bireler, as will aa MeComba and Shaw. Oeerall, the research of the eelolars discussed in
this paper has been very important to the understanding of the media, the manipolation of the public,
aed the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Licswell, Bernese, and Ellul
were formed ware age, they continue bo help ua understand the society that earrounds us tein.
