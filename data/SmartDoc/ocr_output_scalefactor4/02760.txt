igh oe ad eD ssonance and Social ( omparison Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted to
explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed CD
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). CDT allows for three
rélationships to occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equi
librium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each
other; and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another
(West & Turmer, 2000). Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of arousal and dis
comfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to
feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual
usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to the self, Chis need for social comparison can
result in conformity pressures (Trenholm d& Jensen, 2004), Berger and Calabrese (1973) related so-
cial com parison to LRT by stat ing that “Festinger has sugpested that persons seek out similar others
who are proximate when they experience a high level of uncert ainty regarding the appropriateness of
their behavior and/or opinions ina particular situation” (p. 107), Festinger received the Distinguished
Scientist award of the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Senior Scientist

Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger’s legacy is significant, and
ill be recognized in contemporary social science research. Aronson (in
