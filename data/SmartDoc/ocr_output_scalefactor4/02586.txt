The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attre cted to certain media 15 almost as old as

studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some Sp ecific content or by the meciunn

satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s til 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were propos ed when itwas rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greathy to establishing the structure of the approach,

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher, He received his Ph.D. in So-
clology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communicatian at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force ch arged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s tol330s (UPENM, 2001). In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Katz's mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, whois one of the pioneers of gratifications research
Th eir cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the
fu nctional theary model. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
notion that people use the media to their benefit. Ina study by Katz, Gurevitch amd Haas (1973), a subject
which is known as the uses and pratifications research were explored. They viewed the mass eae me “ ia ns
by wh ch individu td SMI ct or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to
their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973)

pee colleague Jay G. Blumer, Le published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 which
were entitled The Uses of Mass Communication. They took a more humanistic approach to looking at “
use. They suggest that media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs of a ieee
