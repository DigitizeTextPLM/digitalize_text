‘manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays. 1928, p. GG). Instead, Bernas (1929) offers the idea
that in attempting to ifoence the public, a husioess must stody what terms the partnership can be
made amicable amd mutually beneficial. [t must explain ibself, its aime, its objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing £0 accept [p. Gh).

Bernays slaborates on these ideas im Public Aelatices (L962). Rather than merely attempting to
