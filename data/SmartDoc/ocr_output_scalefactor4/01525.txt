I. DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

__Research conducted under the title of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuasion,
social influence, 4nd small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance hal-
ance, social judgment, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather af social psychology,
played @ considerahle rode in influencing, imenpersonal research pianeers sich as Festinger, Heth f
Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into che realen of social imeraction,
relational development, and relational contral. This was influenced by che research af such scholars
a6 Knapp, Mehrabian, Aliman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut. During the later part of the decade
and inta the 196s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Raloff, and Berger became popular
along with research into behavioral and commumicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson.
Berger (NMS) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal comm research
agenda. during the past two decades" (p. 406). Today, inerpersonal communication tends to focus
on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or communication as
a function of developing pelationships. Research inie interpersonal communication theory typically
focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissoution of relaticeships. [i has heen recognized
that inberpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Aerger & Calabrese, 1975).

Shanon and Weaver pelabed this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, bot thelr work
