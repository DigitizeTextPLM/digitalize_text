1. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he bad seen in
Europe. Further, the prevlence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative
in Europe. The closest thing in Adarmos experience to the advertising industry in the United States
wast fascit propaganda (Jager, 2004, p. 122). Adorno was Inter to allude to his experience with
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that be saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda (Horkheimer and Aderna, 2002, p. $7). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did
nat agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adornos dissatisfaction with
the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to farther develop
the Idea of the culture industry.

relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important to an understanding of

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adore, paar culture on film and radia cid nat bother te present itself as art. They were instead
a business, and this in tum became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adamo, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adotno referred to as Fordist
capitalism, in which mace production based on the techniques weed by Heory Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hobendahl,
1995, p 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adornowere the Hollywood production system, or
the CES radio netwark that had been associated with the Princeton Hadia Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
2002, p. 98). Mechanical reproduction enzured that there would not be any real change to the system,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p.
106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaffirm the syatem, and Adorno cited Orson Welles

allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it imeffectual
(Friedman, 1981, p. 165), Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
of social control (Horkheimer and Adotno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to chocee in a system of economic
coercion ultimately meant the freedom ta ons the same (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 136).

ase pacha foe san aria BIG as the ricentie af fis scutes industry "(Halaska and
Adora, 2002, p. 101). It was not high art that Adorno was presenting as an alternative to the culture
industry, but modernism. Although he provides the idea of an opposing force to the culture industry,
Adorn provides no overt Marxist analysis. Instead, be notes in passing that the dominant system
ubilized capacities for mass consumption for entertainment or amusement,

Since Adorn had been, in his essays on music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, The
Culture Industry has been criticized as being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture.
Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and
Adorne, 2002, p. 101).
