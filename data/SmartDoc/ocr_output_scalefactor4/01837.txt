Rogers was born in Carroll, Lowa in 1931, He eared his B.A., M.A,, and Ph.D. degrees from lowa
State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S, Air Force. Interestingly,
in 1946, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea,

The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creats applications of diftu-
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously
mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was
suffering from kidney disease, He died on October 21, 2005,

According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
is an idea, practice or abject perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 404).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu-
nication people can get information of un innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, §-M-C-R-E
(e.g, sender-message-channel-receiver-cffect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this §-M-C-R-E commul-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors ot opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(3) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, “Time’ variable
is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inmo-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption, Diffusion research has attempted fo explain the variables
that influence how and why wers and audience adopt.a new information medium, such as the Internet,
decording to evolution af media technology, interpersonal influences are Important even though in the
past the individual is wswelly the unit of analysis, Also, critical mass becomes an iniportant factor in
adapting new media because new iedia are interactive tools and thus are required Oy many users to
gain efficiency. That is, the more people use. the more people get benefits. In this sense, diffusion
theory not only can apply te practical things, hut also can be related to digital divide.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
“(1 Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185), Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure | shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories
follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped. Source by www? gsu.edu ww witr/ docs dif:
fusion! Figure 2 shows that an innovation would spread through society over various periods of time in
a S-shaped curve. However, as noted above, different types of innovations (c.g., the rate of tetracycline
adoption is faster than that of the hybrid seed corm) can have their own different rates in diffusion. Fig-

there are five stages.

lL. Knowledge + or — (selective exposure or awareness of news)
2, Altitudes + or —(people have positive or negative attitude toward innovations)
. Adoption (Decision): people decide to adopt the innowation

. Implementation (regular of standard practice)

. Confinmation [comparing and evaluating)
