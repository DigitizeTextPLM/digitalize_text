Harald Lasswell (1902-197 A) was a
conducting both quantitative an
and discovering the e

prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on
d qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda,
ffect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswell is credited with creating
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis can be

defined as, "...the investigation of communication messages by cateporizing message content inte classifications
in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 194). In an essay entitled “Contents of Communication,”
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence that runs from control to content and from conbert
to audience” (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, “Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects” (p. 84). Content an alysis was @55en-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a fot of work within this area during the
remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also nterested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was aka:
