Already in the late
1930s fudorno evidenced little hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased nad ie
1930s, Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture, since film and radio became the hwo most Popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships, The essay translated as “Om the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pei-
mary problem for Adorno lay in the fact that instead of being enjoved ina concert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
orginal, and Adomo was emphatic in fis condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile miliew
impossible” (Adomo, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph of film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adom, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea- to down of layers of imitations; to Adorno, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general altituce of the Frankfurt school
