1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-percelved needs of audience mem-
bers. Blumlerand Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication mes-
sage for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different
individuals, There is not only ane way that people uses media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons
for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974),

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and
education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their
needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications
for using different media, MeQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person
interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or
problems; emotional release; (7) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Persanal
identity: self reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance (forms of informa-
tion seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based
on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective, Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus
“internal” goal orientation, and envotion stability of “grawth" and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A
structuring of L6 general paradigms of human motivation [MeGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch and Haas

(1973) developed 25 needs taken from the secial and psychological functions of the mass media and
put ther into five categories:

4. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding;
2, Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;
3. Personal integrative needs, incivding credibility, stability. stotus;
4. Social integrative needs, Incivding interacting with fomily ond friends; and
5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion,
Congruously, McQuail's (1993) classification of the following common reasons for media use:

* finding out about relevant events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society and the
world
