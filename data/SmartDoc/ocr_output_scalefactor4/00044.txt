Uncertainty Reduction

11 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundatlon for communication
research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a basle human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Uerecer-
tainty Reduction theory (CRT), accredited to- Charles R. Rergerand Richard J, Calabrese (1975), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development af URT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research, Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 153). The study of informasion is basic
to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field af interpersonal communication. URT places the role of communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social paychological theories as starting points” (p. 99).
The reseorch underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of inter-
personal communication research; with the development of URT, communication researchers began to look to
communication for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social
Scenees.

1.2 The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Traditionally, communication has been viewed as an interdisciplinary field. Interpersonal communication is

mest atten linked to studies inte language, social cognition, and social psychology, Prior to the 1960s, only a

modest amount of research was completed under the label of interpersonal communication. Heath and Bryant

(2000) marked this time as the origin of the field of interpersonal communication: “Particularly since 1960,

scholars adopted communication as the central term because they wanted fo study if oz significant and unique
aspect of human behavior” (p. 3%) The 160s produced res that impacted ihe panent of an in-
lerpersonal field, Research in psychiatry examined personality and the influence of relationships, finding that
psychiatric problems were not only a result of self problems, but a result of relational problems as well, Re-
search trends in humanistic psychology and existentialism inspired the idea that relationships could be improved
