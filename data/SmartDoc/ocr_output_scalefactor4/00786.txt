Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural linguistics.
Ta Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation
by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set
af conventions necessary ta communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which compose
it; a3 opposed to it, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language” (Barthes, 196/,
p.13). Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimension, The structure level,
langue, is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized.
On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However,
itis considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the
shared convention, the structure.

4 language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. itis the social part of
language, itis essentially a collective contract which ane must accept in its entirety if one
wishes to communicate. Itis because a language is a system of contractual Values that it
resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization, The speaking subject can use the cade
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds ta and individual act and mot to a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or mea ning which is expressed through the farm.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Hera, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "I propase to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifier (significant); the last two tanms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959, in R. inns
fed.}, p. 37), The correspondence of the concept/imeaning to the external form is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. lt is not the inevitable internal relation but the differance
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that "language does
not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning fram
within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences”. According to Saussure, “meaning
is produced through a process of selection and co mination of signs along two ames, the syntagmatic
fe.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g., synonyms), organized inte a signifying system” (Barker,
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the follow-
ing sentence: "| went to a theater with my girlfriend." This sentence is established through the
linear combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as | theater, my, and girlfnend can be
substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as "She went fo a restaurant with her mother."
Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated only when
they are related to each other. "Crucially, signs do not make sense by wirtue of reference to entities in
an independent object world; rather, they generate meaning by reference to each other. Thus, mean-
ing is understood as a social convention organized through the relations between signs" (Barker, C.,
2002, p. 29). “Itis central to Saussures argument that red ts meaningful in rélation ta the differance
between red, green, amber, etc. These signs are then organized into a sequence which generates
meaning through the cultural conventions of their usage within a particular context.
