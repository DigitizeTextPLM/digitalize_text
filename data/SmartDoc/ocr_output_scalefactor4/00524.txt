According to evalution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important ever though in the
past the individual is usually the unit of analysis. Also, critical mass becomes an important factor ir

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
“(19 Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (3) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40), Figure | shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories
follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped. Source by www psu.ed ul wewitr/does!dif-
