1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the Idea of the
culture industry outside of a German context. In the years since there have been be
ous criticisms of the text, not least since Adomo made sweeping generalizations about ‘tne
commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Gook, 1996, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, be-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton,
1991, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that ‘the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys-
tem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adomo's idea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the 1960s
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1940s.
While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial soci-
eties between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendanhl,
1995, p. 146-48). Thus, fora some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry would
appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value at all.

Thus for some critics modernist works would be counteracting forces against the dominant
ideology. As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, it may be the case that the
dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of the culture

industry has had an importance in critical theory since its appearance in the 1940s, in that
it has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation to ideology, and
hence, society, Since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about the impact of the culture
industry, and since he did not systematically explore how the culture industry operated, it has
been generally easy for some to dismiss the idea of a culture industry. It is nonetheless the
case that motion pictures are still made by large companies and that their movies largely rely
on formulaic plots. It is also the case that radio is increasingly controlled by a small number
of companies, which tend te impose restrictions on how stations operate. As a broadcast
mentum. television is very much related to both radio and film, and shares with them qualities
