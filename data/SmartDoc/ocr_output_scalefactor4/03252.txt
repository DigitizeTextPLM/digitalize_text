1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on flro and radio did mot bother to present itself as art, They were instead
a, business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally prowuce
(Horkheimer and Adorne, 2002, p. #5). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitalism, 1m which mas production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere insofar ag these tendencies were Lased on centralization and hierarchy {Hohendahl

1995, pP. 142). Examples of thisnat spt sified by Adormowere the Hollywood production system,
