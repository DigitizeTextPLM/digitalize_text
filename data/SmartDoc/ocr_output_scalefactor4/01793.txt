that Adamo would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments
of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on ot
his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, af opposed to
other writers in the Frankfurt School [Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satished and quiescent |Alway, 1995, p. 83). ‘lhe
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose matin objectives were to
maintain social control and continue ta perpetuate the ideal ey that maintained that control.
Erhoine Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination funetions
(Marcuse, 1991, p. 8). However, it is difficult in Marcuses argument to separate culture
or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass
media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno
had done. In the end Marcuses analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant
ideology. Marcuse wrote, “how can the administered individualswha have mace their nut lation
into their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged scoleliberate
themselves from themselves as well as from their masters? How is it even thinkal le that the
virious circle be broken? (Marcuse, 1991, p. 251). Given the pessimistic tone of the DOO,
‘¢ is somewhat ironic that largely because of it he would be perceived as an icon for leftist
movements of the 1960s in the U5. and Germany that developed an oppositional stance.
