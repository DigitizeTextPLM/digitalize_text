Uses and Gratifications

41.1 Introduction

Uses and gratiications approach is an influential tradition in media research. The oiginal
conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of
certain media contents. The cone question af such research is: Why de people use media
and whatdo they use them for? (MeQuail, 1983). There exists a basic idea im this approach:
audience members know media content, and which media they can use to meet thei meets.
in the: mass communication process, used and gratifications aparaach puts te function of
linking need grafificaions and media choice clearly on the side of audience members. If
suggests thal people's needs influence what media they would choose, how they use cer-
fain media and what gratificatians the medka give them. This appeoach differs fran ofher
theoretical perspectives in thal fl regards audiences as actve media users as apposed fa
passive receivers of information, In contrast ta traditional media affects theanes which focus
on “what media do to people” and asqume audianoes are homogeneous, wees and grabfica-
fone approach if. mare cancened with “what people do wath media” (Katz, 1258). It allows
audiences personal needs io use media and responds to ihe media. which determined by
ther social and peyonological background. Uses and grabfications approach abe postulates
that the media compete with other information sources for audionoe's need sablisfaction (Katz
él al,, 1974a). As traditional mass media and new media continue to provide people with a
wide range of media platform and comtand, it is considered ome of ihe most appropriate
perspectives for investgaling why audiences choose lp be expomed aiterant
The approach ompbhasizes audiences’ choice by assessing treir reasons for wang
acortain media to the disregard of ofhers, as wel! as ihe various pratificatians obtained
from the predia, based on individual social and psychological requirements (Severin
& Tankard, 1997). 4s a broader perspective among communication researches, it pro-
vides a framework for understanding the processes by which media particinants seek
infoomation or content selectively, commensurate with their needs and interests (Katr
otal, 1074a). Avovence srenbers then incorporate the content fe full fev needs or
to sadiaty their interests (Lowery & Mahila, 123).
