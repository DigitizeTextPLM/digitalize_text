Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and @ntertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation and indoctrination functions
(Marcuse, 1991, p. &). However, it is difficult in Marcuses argument to separate culture
OF mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass
media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno
had done. In the end Marcuses analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant
ideology. Marcuse wrote, “how can the administered individualswho have made their mutilation
