1. OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1 Other Propaganda Theorists
11 Harobd Laswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propagamda, Harold Laswell was undertaking empirical analrues of propagamda. In
fact, much of ihe propaganda that Lisswell was muamining was acually bemg written by Lippmann himself
(Rogers, L954).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) sews a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research, He focused on
condasting halk qeantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, undersianding the content of propaganda,
aol discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass godience (Pogers, (fd) Lasswelll is credined with creating
the mass. communication procedere of coment analysis (Rogers. 1) Caenerally, content analysis cam be
defined as, °_the invesiigadion of communication mesages by caiegorizing message contontiam Classifications
in order bo measure certain variables” (Rogers, 19414). In an eseay entitled “Contents. of Gommnranication,”
Lawell (146) explains Ghat 6 content analysis ehoeid ike im account ihe frequency wilh which comin
aymbok appear ina message, tee dhrection in which the symbols try io persuade the godience's opinice, aad
the intensity of ihe symbols used. By understanding the content of ihe massage, Lasswell (1945) aims to
achieve the goal of wnderstanding the “stream of influence thai runs from conned to coment and from content
lo aence” [p. FA.

This meched of convene analysis is tied strongly so Laswell (198) early definition of communication which
slated, “Who says wad in which chansel oo whom and with whar effects” (p. 41). Content analyscs was essen
tally dha sans what pect of this definition, and Laswwell wear on to doa lotod work within this anea during the
remainiler of his cariser

Aside from mlertanding the content of propagemda, Lassuell was also inverted in how peupedjamda could
shape publicopinion. Thisdeall primarily with undermarding the effects of the media, Lavewell was purtaselarly
innersned im examining the effects of ihe media ic creating public opinion within a democratic eesem, be this
way, Lawewell has cremed a crete, whereby the public is limined ie the information that is presented 6 them,
and also appeehensive ip accept fh. However, it is sill dat information thar is affecting their decisions: within
the democratic syanem, and is being poesemed to them by dhe government. This is an interesting way od viewing,
ihe power of the media that is somewhat similar or Lippmann’: theories.

1.2 Edward Bermays (1291-1995)

Ar appeonimately the same lime that Lippman and Laswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Berens (1501-0995) was examining public relanons, propagacla, ard public opinion. Bermays (32H)
defines propaganda ai, a eeesistent, enduring effon 90 create or shape wins to influence che relations of a
public co an enterprise, idea, or group [p. 25) Comrary in other propaganda theaisis, Bemays necogniacs

Raed on these ideas that dhe public opinion cam be modified, and that such shaping is a secessary part of
society, Bemays pursued he work in the Geld od poblicrelagons, “Poblic relations ix the atempé, by information,
