1930s Adomea evidenced litth hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
19305, Benjamin and Adome debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most papular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “Qn the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect @ pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adomo lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adorno was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape irom tie ate infantile milieu
