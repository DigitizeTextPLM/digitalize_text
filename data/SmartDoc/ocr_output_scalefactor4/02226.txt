1. CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public. and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing
public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement revarding his phrase
the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning mite
than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity and
propaganda (Bernays, 1955, p.22), Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent a different view of
the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea
that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be

made amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, ta the

public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 66).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas m Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Hernays,
1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public ts possible. Bernays (1952) writes ef the
henefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade or suggest Courses of action (p. LO}. Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.
