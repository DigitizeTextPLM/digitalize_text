gue, is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized
On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However,

itis considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the
shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of
language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one
wishes to communicate. It is bacause a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is bath institution and system speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought, It is because speecn is

essentially a combinative activity that it corres ponds to and individual act ana not to a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system inte two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which Is expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "l propose to ratain ihe word sign (signe) te
