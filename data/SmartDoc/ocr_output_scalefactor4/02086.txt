1. OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

1 Other Propaganda Theorists
LL Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harald Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda, In
fact, much af the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himself
(Rogers, 1954).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on
conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda,
and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Ragers, 1994). Lasswell is credited with creating
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994), Generally, content analysis can be
defined as, ~...tbe investigation of communication messages by caregorizing message content into classifications
in order to measure certain variabbes" (Rogers, 1944). In an essay entitled “Contents of Communication,”
Lasswell (1946) explains that a convent analysis should take into accouns the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the inensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims ta
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that runs from control to conbent and from content
to audience’ (p. 7a).

This method of content analysis is tied stronply to Lasswell (7953) early definition of communication which
stated, "Who says what in which channel io whom and with what effects’ tp, 64). Content analysis wat easen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to doa Lot of work within this area during the
Temainder of his career,

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. [n this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that bs presented to them,
and alse apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still chat information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government, This isan interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s thearles.

1.2 Edward Bernays (1991-1995)

At approximately the samve time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public apinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays (1525)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of ai
public to an enterprise, idea, oF proup fp. 25). Conarary to oiler Propaganda peeia E Bemays recognizes
that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public. ican help indeveceael decide what to think
about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be benelicial to society's functioning as a whale.
Bemays states, “We ane governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, ur ideas sugested, Largely by
men we have never heard of... Wast numbers of human belngs must cooperate in this manner lf they are to live

caer ee a that fabs opinion can be modified, and thas such shaping is a necessary part of
society, Bernays pursued his work inthe field of public relations. "Public relations is the altempe, Wig TE MTs
