Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theon, Information exchange is a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. D'ncer-
faint Reduction theory (URT), accredited to Charles Kh. Berger and Richard J, Calabrese (1973), recognized that
reducing: Uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research. Heath and Bryant (20000) state: “Ome of the motivations underpinning interpersonal Communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 153). The study of information is basic
to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the role of communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the ficld of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social psyc hological theories a5 starting points” (p. 94),
The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of inter
personal communication research: with the development of URI, communication researchers began to look to
communication for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social

SCIENCES.

1.2 The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Traditionally, communication has been v1 ewed as an interdisciplinary sa Interpersonal communication 13
most often linked to studies into language, 20¢ ial cognition, and social psychology. Prior to the 1960s, only a
modest amount of research was completed under the label of interps ai communication. Heath and Bryant
(2000) marked this time as the origin of the field of interpersonal communication: “Particularly since 196i),
scholars adopted communication as the ¢ ventral term because they wanted to study if ay a significant ana unique
aspect of human behavior” (p. 39). The 1960s produced research that impacted the development of an in-
terpersonal field. Research in psychiatry examined personality and the influence of re ationships, finding that
psychiatric problems were not only a result of self problems, but a result of relational problems as well, Re-

search trends in humanistic psychology and existentialism inspired the idea that relationships could be improved
