(Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further deve te
Lewin's theories, Several of Festinger thearies were highly influential on the emerging field of in-
lerpersonal communication and on the development of URT. Festinger is best known for the theories
of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison, Cognitive Dissonance theory (COT) amempted to
explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed on
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). CDT allows for three
relationships to occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in eqjui=
librium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each
other; and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no citect on one another
(West & Tumer, 2000), Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of arousal and dis
camfart that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to
feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual
usually secks the opinions of others who are similar to the self. This need for social comparison can
result in conformity pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, 2004). Berger and Calabrese (1973) related so-
cial comparison to URT by stwting that “Festinger has suggested that persons seck out similar others
who are proximate when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of
their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation” (p. 107). Festinger received the Distinguished
Scientist award of the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Senior Scientist
Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology, Festinger’s legacy is significant, and
his theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research. Aronson (in
Festinger, 1980) stated, “It was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of
cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, social psychology has not been the same since” (p. 3).

Fritz Heider earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Graz, The saonn
Europe, Heider worked with many renowned psychologists such as Wolfgang Kohler, Max Wertheimer
and Kurt Lewin, Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin as a substantial impact on his life:
to pay tribute to Lewin stimulating influence, which has affected much of es eat
