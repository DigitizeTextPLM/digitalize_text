(Rogers, 1994)

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on
conducting both quantitative and qualitative an vses of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda,
and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswell is cnedited with creating
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis can be
defined as, "...the investigation of communication messa ges by categorizing message content into classifications
In Order to Measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled “Contents of Communication,”
Lasswell (1546) explains that a content analysis should take inte account the frequency with which certain
symbaols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the intensity of the svinbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that runs from control to content and from content
to audience” (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is tied strongly ta Lasswell (1953) early detinition of communication which
stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects” (p. 84). Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the
remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories.

1.2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and pepe eeria,
Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, pr opaganda, and pi blic opinion. Bermays (1928)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effort to create of shape ev nis to wi Tcl the relations of a
public to an enterprise, idea, or group (p. 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorists, aero eas
that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public. It can help in ctivice ls decide what to think
about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to societ y's functioning a3 4 whole.
