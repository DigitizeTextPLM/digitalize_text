fan be molded at will or dictated to |Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernaye (1928) offers the idea
that in attempting to wence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is Willing ta accept [p. &6).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Be a presents public relations as a tool that can be
used to combine the ideas of the publi: the pereuader. The objective-minded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Hernays
1352, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognises the power of
eoclety, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
henefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects ws, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade or suggest courses of action (p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as

Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.
