ucation, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their

needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications
for using different media. MeCuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person
interactions” to classify four Important media pratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or
problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship, social utility; (3) Personal
identity: self reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance (forms of informa-
tion seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based
on a general theory of human needs, He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus
“internal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “growth” and "preservation." When charted,
these factors yield L6 different types of motivations which apply te media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974), Katz, Gureviteh and Haas

put them inte five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including gequiring information, knowledge and understanding;
_ Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;

_ Personal integrative needs, including cre dibility, stability, stentus,

4. Social integrative needs, including jateraeting with family and friends; and

_ Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.
