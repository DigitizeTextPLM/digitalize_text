esearch conducted under the title of interpersonal communication indtially focused oa persuasion,
sodal influence, and small group processes, Theories explored che role of learning, dissonance, hal-
ance, social fjodgment, and reactance (Berger, 2006). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology,
a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such a3 Festinger, Header,
Kelley, and Hovland. By the 1970s, research interests began to shaft into the realm of social interaction,
relational development, and relational conmrol, This was influenced by the research of such scholars
as Knapp, Mehrablan, Aleman, Tayloc, Duck, Kelley, and Thahaut. During the laber part af the decade
and into the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Raloff, and Berger became papular
along with researeh inte behavioral and communicative adaptation by Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson.
Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal comm research
agenda during the past two decades" (p. 416). Today, inmerpersenal comeunicacion tends. te focus
on dyadic communication, communication invalving face-to-face interacthan, or Communication as
a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal communication theory typically
focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolution of relationships. ft has been recogmined
that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 14%)
Since ils intredduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as 2 major field of stacy thar has
contributed to the development of the Geld of communication asa whole. This chapter strives to focus
om those theorises who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their work

understanding of interpersenal processes,

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since wacetainty has been identified as am important construct, mecessary to the soudy af comma:
nication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined
and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through ihe theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1945) proposed char uncertainty existed in a given situation when there
Wat & high amount of possible alternatives and che probabiliny of their event was relatively equal
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
