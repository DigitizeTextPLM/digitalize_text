Rogers was born in Carroll, lowa in 1931, He earned his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from lows
State University, For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly.
in 1966, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea.

The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theary and it creats applications of diffu-
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously
mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was
suffering from kidney disease, He died on October 21, 25,

According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu-
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption, The diffu-
sion of innovations invelves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 405).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication of mass comumnu-
nication people ean get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell

(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, §-M-C-R-E
(e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-elfect). Rogers ( 1995) mentioned, “this §-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
ean be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theary, “Time" variable
is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovaliveness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption, Most inna-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables
