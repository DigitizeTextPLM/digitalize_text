i. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience merm-
bers. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication mes:
sage for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different
individuals. There is not only one way that people uses media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons
for using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and
education, affect peaple’s ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their
needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications
for using different media, McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person
interactions” te classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or
problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; sacial utility, (3) Personal
identity: self reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance (forms of informa-
tion seeking}.

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based
ona general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” wersus
“internal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of "grawth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use [Figure 1}, Figure 1. A
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (MeGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch and Haas
[1973] developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
put them into tive categories:

. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding;
. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;

. Personal integrative needs, Including crecibility, stobility, status;

. Sociol integrative needs, Including interacting with family and frends; and

. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Congruously, MeQluail’s (1983) classification of the following common reasons for media use:

* finding out about relevant events and conditions in immediate surroundings, society and the
warld

seeking advice on practical matters or opinion and decision choices
satishying curiosity and general interest
learning; self-education

gaining a sense of security through knowledge

finding reinforcement for personal values
finding models of behavior
identifying with valued others (in the media}

gaining insight into oneself
