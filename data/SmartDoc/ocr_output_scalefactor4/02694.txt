social influence, and small group processes. Theories explored the role of learning, dissonance, b
ance, social judement, and reactance (Berger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social

played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider,
Kelley, and Hovland, By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction,
relational development, and relational control. This was influenced by the research of such scholars
#6 Knapp, Mehrabian, Alaman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, amd Thibaut. During the later part of the decade
and inte the 1980s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Rolotf, and Berger became popular
along with research into behavioral and communicative adapration by Giles, Burgoon, and Paterson.
Berger (2005) states: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal comm research
agenda doring the past owo decades” (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communicacion tends to focus
on dyadic communicathon, communication involving face-to-face interaction, ar communication as
a function of developing relationships. Research into interpersonal commeanication theory typically
fomses of the development, maintenance, and dissolucion of relationships. It has been recognized

that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1975).
Since its introduction in the 1970s, uncertainty has been recognized as a major fleld of study thar has
contribated to the developenent of the field of communication as.a whole. This chapter strives te focus
on those theocits who pioneered the research of uncertainty reduction in communication. Their werk
is crucial 06 the development of the field of interpersonal communication, and is central in our
understanding of interpersonal processus,

1 Defining Uncertainty

Sino: uncertainty has been klentified as am lepertant construct, necessary to the snody of comma-
nicadon, i would be beneficial oo know when the concept originated, and how it has bem defined
and studied. Cine way to consider uncerainry is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) peopised that uncertainty existed ina Riven situation when there
was a high amount of possible allematives and dhe probability of their event was relatively equal.
Shanson and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the ransmission of messages, bet their work
also contribuied to the development of LET. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the
information theorists as well as Heider (1958) research in attribution, Berger and Calabrese (19S)
expanded the concep! of uncemainty io fic interpersonal comenunication by defining ancerainty a
the “number of allermacnve ways in which each interactan might behave" (p. 100), The greaner the
