THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in
Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative
in Europe. The closest thing in Adornos experience to the advertising industry in the United States
was fascist propaganda (Jager, 2004, p. 122), Adorno was later to allude to his experience with
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda [Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 87). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did
not agree on the value of empirical studies. and Adorno left the project. Adornos dissatisfaction with
the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop

Horkheimer, who had already moved to California, could nof bring Adorno te the West Comet wnt
Noventiber P47. When Adorno was finally able to relocate, fe joined an expatriate community that
included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Bisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred DÃ©blin, ana
Bertolt Brecht, several of which found werk in the Holliaeood mowe mousity. The fact that Adaria
was port of this intellectual communtiy whose menihers were invomed in the production af Holitpwood
mowes must hove hod some influence in developing has thoughts on culture, since the Hollywood system
inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany

These preconditionsAdornos interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the
relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important to an understanding of

his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Aderno, 2002, p. 85). This lusiness was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitalism, in which mass production based om the techniques wed by Henry Pord were implemented in
the cultural phere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl,
1995, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adormmowere the Hollywood production system, of
the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Hadio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work [Horkheimer and Adorno,
2002, p. $9). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge |Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p.
106-7). Paradesically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, and Adore cited Orson Welles
16 an example of someone whe was allowed to break the rules. Uhe elasticity in the sysbem would
allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual
(Friedman, 1981, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
of social control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom te choose in a system of ecoromit
coercion ultimately meant the freedom to be the same [Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 136).

Since Aderno had been, in his essave on music and radio, an apparent defender f hich art. The
Culture Industry has been criticized ac being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture.

1 spectically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and

Adorno, 2002, p. LOL). it was mot high art that Adorno was presenting a8 an alternative te the culture
industry, but modernism. Although he provides the idea of an opposing force to the culture industry.
Adorno provides no overt Marxist analysis, Instead, he notes in passing that the dominant system
utilized capacities for mass consumption for entertainment or amusement,
