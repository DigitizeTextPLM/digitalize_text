Rogers was born in Carroll, lowa in 1931. He eamed his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Iowa
State University, For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Foree. Interestingly,
in 1966, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea.

The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creats applications of diffu-
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously

mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was
suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005.

According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an in novation is commu-

nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. Ihe diffu-

sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication of mass commu

nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell

(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, 5-M-C-R-E

(e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-eftect). Rogers (1993) mentioned, “this 5-M-C-R-E commu-

nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion" (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be

interpersonal of mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally

(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffuston theary, “Time’ variable |
is avery important factor, According to Rogers (1995), time variable ts involved in diffusion in (1)

the innovation-decision process: (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-

vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Onfievos research has ottempied to explain the variables

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to [nnovativencss;
“71) Innovators (venturesome?, (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Lageards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995. pp. 183-185). Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting mew ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure | shows the relationships betwoen types
of adopters divided by inntvativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories
follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped. Source by wwews. gsu.cd weewdinidiecs dif:

a S-shaped curve. However, a5 noted above, different types ofFinnayvalions (e.g., the mite of tetracycline
adoption is faster than that of the hybrid seed comm) can hawe their own different rates iin diffusion. Fig-
