resists the modifications coming from a single individual and ls consequently a social inst-

an individual act of selection and actualizatian, The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that it correspands to and individual act and not to a pure

creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two pans, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.
g
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the axtemal forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and te replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifier (significant), the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and fram the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis
(ed.), p. af). The correspondence of the conceptimeaning to the external form is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation It is not the inevitable internal relation but the differance
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that "language does
not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning fram
within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences” According to Saussure, "meaning
is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic
(e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (@.g., synonyms}, organized into a signifying system” (Barker
2002, p. 29) As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible si
