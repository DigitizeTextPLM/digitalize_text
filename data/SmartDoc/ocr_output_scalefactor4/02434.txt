_ THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in
Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative
in Europe. The closest thing in Adornos experience to the advertising industry in the United States
was fascist propaganda (Jéger, 2004, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience with
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did
net agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adornos dissatisfaction with
the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop
the idea of the culture industry.

Because of the relationship between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University,
Horkheimer, who had already moved to California, could not bring Adorno to the West Coast until
November 1941. When Adorno was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate community that
included Frits Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Bisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Déblin, and
Bertolt Brecht, several of which found work in the Hollywood mowie industry. The faet that Adorno
was part of this intellectual community whose members were involved in the production of Hollywood
movies must have lad some influence in developing Ais Hhoughts on culture, since the Hollywood system
inhibited the creative freedom that mony of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany.

These preconditionsAdornos interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the

relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important to an understanding of
his concern for the idea of the culture industry.
