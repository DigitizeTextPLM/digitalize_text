1. CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generating propaganda in influencing
public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase,
the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more
than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity and
propaganda (Bernays, 1955, p.22). Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent a different view of
the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this, He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which
ean be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea
that in attempting to infinence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial, It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the
public in terme which the public can understand and is willing te accept [p. 66).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations
Tian helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays,

1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of

society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them

to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,

and to persuade or suggest courses of action (p. LO}. Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed fy Lippmann, Lasswell, Eilul, and Bernays are important for a number of
reasons, Based am the ideas of his predecessors, Lippmann was able to bring attention te the fact that
