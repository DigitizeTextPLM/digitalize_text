the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as Sea ee
nipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass on
ean be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea
that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain its If, its aims, its objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 6b)

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting ta
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations a8 a tool that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations
man helps his client adjust te the contemporary situation, oF helps the public adjust to it (Bernays,
1952, p. 9), Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public ts possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade or suggest courses of action (p. 10}. Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as

Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.
