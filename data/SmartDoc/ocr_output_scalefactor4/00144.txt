1, THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIG HTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen In

Burope. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was in the United Stat
in Europe, The closest thing in Adarnos experience to the advertising industry in the United Stat
was fasciat propaganda (Jiger, 201M, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience ee
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the aba
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from politic
propaganda (Horkhelmer and Adora, 2002, p, 97). [t became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did
Tat agree oo the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adornos dissatisfaction with
the work of the Princeton Radio Research Praject would eventually motivate him ta further develop
the idea of the culture bodustry, J a oot ep Higa

November 1941. When Adomo was finally able to relocate, he joined on expatriate community that
included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Eisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred Déblin, and
Bertolt Brecht, aeweral of which found mork in the Hollywood movie industry. The fact that Adorno

movies must han Aad some influence in developing Ais thoughts on culture, since the Hollywood system
inhibited the creative freedom thot many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany.

These preconditiansAdornes interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radia Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in Califormia and the
relationship of several of these to the Holbwood film industryare all important to an understanding of
his concern for the hiea of the culture budustry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adomnio, papular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead
it business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 05). This business was based on what Aderno referred to aa Fordist
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural aphere, inacfar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl,
1905, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adornowere the Hollywood production system, oF
the CBS radio network that had been asociated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Mavies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno
2002, p. #9). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system,
amd that nothing tray adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Pugin 2002 ;
M06-7], Paradaxically, any Innovation would only reaifirm the system, and Adamo cited Crean Welles
as an example of someone who was allawed to break the rules. ‘The elasticity in the syatem would
allow it to assume the stance of any ppposition and make it its awn, Ultimately tendering it ineffectual
(Friedman, 1981, y- 165). Like region and other institutions, the culture industcy was an ae
of social control (Harkhrimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choase in a system of een Pari
epercion ultimately meant the freedom to be the same (Horkhelmer and Adama, X02 F 136) ti
