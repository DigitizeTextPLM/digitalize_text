1 Needs and Gratifications

em-
Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the elf-percelved eae pleecrs
bers. Blumlerand Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the Peat
sage for very different purposes. The same media content may eratify different needs ve
individuals. There is not only ome way that people uses media. pina there are as many rea

the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974). ‘

a ae needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and
education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their
needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives aie gratifications
for using different media. MeQuail, Humler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person
interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from feutine or
problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal
identity: self reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance (forms of informa-
tion seeking].

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based
on @ general theory of human neds. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective, Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus
“internal” goal orlentation, and emotion stability of "growth" and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different tyes of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch and Haas
(29743) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
pul thern iivbe five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding:
2. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings:

3. Peronol integrative needs, including credibility, stability, status;

4. Social integrotive needs, including interacting with fomily and friends: and

5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion,
