Be Sele (Bemaye, 1955, p22). Hernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase,
eee of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more
7 anything else that distinguishes modern public relations fram old-time hit or miss publicity and
propagatida (Bernays, 1955, p22). Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent a different view of
the formation of public opinion, In opposition to Lippmann, whe views the public aa being easily
Matipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1028, p. 64). Instead, Bernays (1028) offers the idea
that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be
made amicable: and mutually beneficial, [t must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept {p, 66).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relationa as a tool that can be
used bo combine the ideas af the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it [Hernays,
1952, p. 9). Bernaye view of the polblic i softer than that of Lipypanann, as he recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipalation of the public is possible. Hernays (1052) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
te understand the socety of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpaint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects we, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to perauade or suggest courses of action [p. 10}. Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it ia not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Losewell, Bll, and Hernags are important for o number of
reasons. Based on the ideas of Mis predecessors, Lippraann sos ahte to bring oltendion to the fact that
the public ia aide to be influenced by the media. The work of Lippmann and hts colleoques hoa fed to more
recent research that is meant to help understand the influence of the media on the public. Through the
work Iyengar and Kinder, White, Lewin, and MeCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensive enderstonding
of the media has been developed. The public has nou been made aivare various medio fienctions suck os

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the direct effects and limited effects
ioedia models, Theorlsts such ae Ellal tended to side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
propaganda could directly influence: the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, theorists auch as Lippmann
alen noted that the media might not be influencing anky thought, but oay ale be influencing what
people thought about. Tt was this line of thinking that. resultest it a starting point for future research
in the ares af the limited effects of the media, Such limited citects were shown throwel the work of
Lyengar and Kinder, as well as MeCombe and Shaw, Chverall, the research of the scholars discussed Ln
this paper has been very important to the understanding of the media, the manipulation a ate pablic,
and the formation of public opinian. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasewell, Bernays, and Ella
were formed years ago, they continue ta help us understand the society that surrounds us tociy.
