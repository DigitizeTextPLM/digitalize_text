1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses ared gratifications aporaach emphasizes motives and the seld-perceived needs of audience mem-
bers. Blumiler and Ratz (1974) concluded that different people can use the sare communication mps-
sage for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for ditlerent
individuals. There i not only one way that people uses media. Contrarily, (here are as marry reasons
for using the media as there are media users (Rumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individisal’s background, such a5 experience, interests, and
education, affect people's ideas about what they wart from media and which media best meet their
needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gretifications
for using diferent media. McCkuail, Bluenler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-persan
interactions” to classty four ienportant media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or
problems: emotional release; (7) Personal relationships: compansonsheg; social utility; [3] Personal
idengity; self reference; reality exploration; value reirdorpes; and (4) Surveillance {forms of informa-
(iar soe big.

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based
on 4 general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitwe and
Affect Then he added three dimensions; “active” versus “passe” initiation, “external” wersuss
“intemal” goal orientation, and ematian stability of “grrvth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 GMerent types of motivations which apply to media use [Figure 1}. Fapare 2. A
