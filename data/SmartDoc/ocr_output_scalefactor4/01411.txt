1 Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

In order 10 understand the creation of the ides of the calture industry oo welll as its reception the concept can be
examined chronologically, from its pre-comditions, through its generatiog, to its subsequent Impact. The idea ant
the culbare industry grows out of a. concern with culture, is developed theough insights into the mechanical re-
jon of colture, and is ultimately generated in opposition mot only to popular music, bet gio to Hollywioand
movies. That this is so grows oul of a number of historical contingencies.
Adomo was intesdwced to Walter Benjamin in [87), ard the ten theorists became friends. Since Benjaman

departure from Germany, bot also affected his philosepiuical thought. As Jingen Habermas would later note, the

riewces influencing the dewelopmest of critical theary, the others being Stalinist repression and the production
