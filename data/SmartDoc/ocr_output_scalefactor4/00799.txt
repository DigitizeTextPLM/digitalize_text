1. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization af culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in
Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising In the United States was scamething with no correlative
in Europe. The closest thing in Adorno: experience to the advertising industry in the United State:
was fascist propaganda (Jiger, 2004, p, 122). Adomo was later ta allude to his experience with
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by meting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indlatinguishable from political
propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). Tt became obvious that Lazarsield and Adorno did
not agre: on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno Ieft the project, Adotnos dissatisfaction with
the werk of the Princeton Radia Research Praject would eventually motivate him to further develop
the idea of the culture industry.

Becouse of the relationship betucen the dnstitute for Sociol Research and Cofumibia University,
Hortheimer, who Aad aiready moved to Codifornia, conld not bring Adorno to the Mest Cooat until
November (51. When Adommo was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate commnenity that
included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hons Bisler, Thomas ond Peinrich Mann, Alfred Dahlin, and
Bertolt Brecht, seceral of which foond monk in the Hollwood monte industry. The fact that Adorno

These preconditionsAdornes interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, as well az involvement with the expatriate community in California and the
relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film Industryare all important te an understanding of
his concern for the idea of the culture industry,

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Aderno, popular culture an film and radia did nat bother te present iteelf as art. They were instead
4 business, and this in turn became an ideology to Inpitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitilism, in which mast production based on the techniques weed by Henry Ford were bmplemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were baged an centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl,
1985, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adormmowere the Hollywood prodwetion system, or
the CHS medio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and bit gongs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
DI02, p. 990. Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would oot be any real change te the system,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emetpe (Horkheimer and Adomo, 2002, p.
10-7). Paredesteally, any inoovatlon would only reaffirm the eyatem, and Aderoo cited Orson Welles
ac an exemple of someone who was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would
allow it to aztume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual
(Friedman, 1981, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
of social control (Horkheimer and Adora, 202, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a eystem of economic

Adorno, S02, p. 101). Tt was not high art that Adare was presenting as an alternative to the culture
industry, but modernism. Although he provides the idea of an opposing force to the culture industry,
Adorno provides no overt Marxist analysis. Instead, be notes in passing that the dominant system
utilized capacities for mass consumption for entertainment or amusement,

Since Adorno had been, in his essays on music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, The
Culture Industry has been criticized as being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture.
Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and
Adorno, 2002, p. 101}.
