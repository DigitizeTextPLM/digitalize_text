There are five differem bopes of adopters in the diffusion process, scoording to Innowaliwemess:
“(1) lemovators (venturesoeme), (2) Earty Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Lane Majority (skeptical), and (3) Laggards (tradicional) (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185}. Rogers defined
this tents as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adogeing new ideas than other
members of his social system (Rogers, (43, p. 40). Fagure | shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innovetivences and their place om the adoption curve. Also, these cmlegories

a S-shaped curve. However, as noted above, different types.af inmevations (e.g the rabe of tetracycline
adoption is faster than that of the hybrid seed com) can have their owe different rates in diffusion. Fig-
