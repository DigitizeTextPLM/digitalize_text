1.1 Harald Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harolel Lasswell wasu

(Rogers, 144).
Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on

conducting both quantitative and quatitative analyses of propaganda, understanding te coment of PPAR
and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mast audience (Rogers, 1954). Lasswell is creda aa
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, com! OU z ana

Lasswell (146) explains that a content analysis should take into accaunt the frequency with which ne ay
symbols appear in a message, che directian in which the symbols ty to persuade the audience's opinion,

the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1546) aims. to
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influenme that runs fram contre to content and from content
to audience* (p. 74). :

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects” (p. a4), Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on todo a lotef wark within this area during the
remainder al his career.

Aside from understanding the contentof propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in haw propaganda could
shape public opinion, This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the infarmation that is presented to thers,
and alsa apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still chat information that is affecting their decisions within
the demacratic system, and is being presented to them by the government, This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media thas is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories.

12 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann amd Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bemays (1291-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bermays (1920)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, erduring effort to create of shape events to influence the relacions of a
public to an enterprise, idea, or group ip. 25). ‘Contrary to other propaganda theotists, Bemays moognizes
that propaganda can be either beneficial ar harmful to the public. It can help individuals decide what to think
about of alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to society's functioning as a whole.
Bemays states, “We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by
men we have newer heard of... Wast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live
together a6 aamoathly functioning society (p. 9),
Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be modified, ancl that such ing i
