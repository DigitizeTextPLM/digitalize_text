1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty his been identified as am impertant construct, mecessary to the study o
ficetion, it would be beneficial 1 know when the concept ceigisated, and how it has been
and studied. One way io consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of infomation
heary. Shannoa and Weaver (1949) proposed char uncertainty existed ina given situation when there
was a high amount of possible aliematves and the probability of their event was relatively equal
Shannon are Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
abo comribated to the development of VET, Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the
information theceisis 25 well as Helder (1958) research in amriteacion. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of umcemaanty to fit interpersonal communacation by defining wmcestainty as
ibe “number of altemacive ways in whoch each interactant might behave" (p. LOM). The greater the
adinty that exists im a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able p

predicting present amd past behaviors, tut also explaining why partners behave or bebeve in the way
that they do. Berger and Bradac's (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this
process when they gated: “Lincertainry, then, can stem from the Linge number of alternative hliegs
that a stranger can beliews or potentially say" Uncertainty plays a significant pole when examining
relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational development, LARC can
