Understanding of the public necessity of atbention-fenerating propaganda im influencing

propaganda (Bernays, 1955, p22). Furthermore, Bernays theories algo represent & different view of
of public opinion. In opposition bo Lippmann, wht views the public as bemg easily

manipulated, Bernaye cautions against this. He claims. The public is not an amorphous mase which

mm be molded at will or dictated to ([Bernays, 1928, p. 66) Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea

in attempting to influence the public, a busimess must 51 udv what terms the partnership can be

made amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, ite objectives, to tne

public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 66

Rernave elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations a6 2 tool that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader The objective minded public relations

1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, a5 he recog nizes the power of
eacjety. Twat atill also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations 18 important because it helps them
to urlerstand the society of 9 h we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
ta exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade or suggest courses of action (p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as

Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories
The theories developed by Lippmann, Losewell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of
reasons. Based on the ideas of hia predecessors, Lippmann was able to bring attention to the fact that

recent research that is meant bo help understand the infinence of the media on the puoite. Through the

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the direct effects and limited effects
media melels. Theorists such as al tended to side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby,
propaganda could directly influence the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippmann
alen noted that the media might not be influencing only thought, but may also be influencing what
people thought about. It was this line of thinking that resulted im a sha point for future research
in the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work of
Iyengar and Kinder, as well as McCombs and Shaw. Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in
this paper has been very important to the understanding of the media, the manipulation of the public,
and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lazewell, Bernays, ad Elhal

were formed years ago, they continue to help us understand the society that surrounds us today.
