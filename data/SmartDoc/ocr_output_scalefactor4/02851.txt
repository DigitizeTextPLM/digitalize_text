1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications aporoach emphasizes motives and the self-perockeed needs of audience mem-
bers. Bluenler and Katz (1974) concluded that different peaple can ute the sane communication mes:
sage for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify deferent meeds for different
individuals. There is not only one way that people uses media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons
for using the media ad there are media users (Bbumiler & Kate, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and
education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their
needs. Thal i, dudsence members are aware af and can state their own motes and Bratifications
for using different media. MMcCuail, Blumer, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person
interactions” te classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or
problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companaanship; social utility: (3) Personal

identity: self reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance (horns of informa.
tan seeking),

Another subdnided verssan al the aid neativatian was suggested by Mocuire (1974), based
on 4 general theory of human reeds. He distinguished between two types of needs: cogoitve and
atective. Then he added three dimenai “active” wermus “passive” initiation, “external” versus
“intemal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yeetd 16 diferent types ed motivations which apoly to media use [Figure 1). Fagure 2. A
