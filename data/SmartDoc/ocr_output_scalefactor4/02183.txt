that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership car be
made amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing te accept (p. Bb. ;

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernaye presents public relations as 4 tool that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader, The objective-minded public relations

1952, p. 9). Dernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
society, but atill also claims that manipulation ef the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them

the public is still possible, it is mot in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. “Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagres with this point.
