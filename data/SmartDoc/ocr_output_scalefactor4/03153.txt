1. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

| Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far baryenudl rhea et hal ee
Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something if Espa eae
in Eurape. The closest thing in Adarnos experience to the advertiang industry in t ve Unit pal
was fascist propaganda (Jager, 2004, p. 122). Adorno waa later to allude to his experience W

| the Frincetan Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). Tt became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did

not agree on the valve of emplrical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adornas dissatisfaction with

! the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him te further develop

he idea of the culture industry.
Because of the relationship between the Jnstitute for Social Research and Columita CincttrerstEy,
| Horkhcimer, who hod already moved to Califernia, could not bring Adorno to the West Coast until
Nevernter 1947, When Adore woa finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate community fat
| included Fritz Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hons Eisler, Thomas and Hetrrich Aann, Alfred Déilin, and
Bertolt Brecht, several of which found work in the Hollywood movie industry. The fact that Adorna
| was part of this intellectual commanity mhase members were involwed in the production af Hollywood
monies must have Aad some influence in developing Ais thoughts on culture, ince the Mollynood system
inkildted the creative freedom that many of the expolniates hod enjoyed in Weimar Germany.

} These preconditionsAdornmes Interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radia Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the
telationship of several of these to the Mollywood film industryare all important to an understanding of

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular calture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art, They were Lostead
i business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere. inswfar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl,
1995, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adornowere the Hollywood production system, or
the CBS radio network that bad ben asiociated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Mavins
and bit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the wark (Horkheimer and Adorna

2002, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 200% =
106-7). Paradesically, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, and Adarno cited Oreon Wellec
a5 an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules. The élasticity in the system would
allow it 10 assume the stance af any opposition and male it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual
(Friedman, 1881, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
of social control (Horkheimer and Adora, 2002, pf. 120), but freedom to choose in & system of economi

enercion ultiinately meant the freedom ta be the same (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 136) :
