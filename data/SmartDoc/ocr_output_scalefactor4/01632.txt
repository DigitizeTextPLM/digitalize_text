optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brumkborst, 1999, p. 62). A pris
mary problem for Adomo lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phanaygragh records, The result was inferior to the
original, and Adom was ¢mphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of musk: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help ta moke escape from the whole infantile milieu

as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adamo, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticih, To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea ta down of layers of imitations; to Adena, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adore. In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continge working im
New York, obtained a position for Adorno ut the Princeton Radio Research Project, run by Paul Lazars-
feld. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although he later claimed that he did not know what a “radio project” was. For eh
