That 15, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu-

nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful, Lasswell

(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, $-M-(-R-E

(e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1993) mentioned, “this $-M-C-R-E commu-

nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p, 19}. Spevifically, (1) sendber

can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
($) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, “Time” variable
is a very important factor. According to Regers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovuation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innevation’s rate of adoption. Most inna
