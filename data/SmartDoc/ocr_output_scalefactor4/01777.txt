1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media and audiences:

L. The audience is conceived as active, i.e, an important part of of mass media use is
assumed to be goal oriented ... patterns of media use are shaped by more or less
definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience
Tmernoer.

2. In the mass communication process much initiative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on
theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and
behavior.

4, The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
mass communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs,
and the depree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consump-
tion certainly varies.

4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- ie, people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in

cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience orlentations are explored on their own terms. (p. 15-17).

then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The current status of uses and
pratifications is still based om Pare’s first analysis, particularly as mew media formes have emerged in
such an electronic information age when people have core options of media we.

1 Weeds and Gratifications

Lises and gralitications approach emphasices motives and the self-perceived needs of audience mem-
bers, Blumer and Rate (7974) concluded that different people can use the same conumunication mes
sage for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for differene
indivichals. There is not only one way that people wies oeedia. Contrarily, there are as many reasons
for using the media as there are media users (Blumer & Katz, 19774).

Rosie needs, social situation, and the individual’: bockground, such as experience, imereses, cna

for using different media. Motucil, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a mite! af “media-persan

interactions" to classify four impartial teed genni fomians:

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study of Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows.

In ackdlition, Katz, Blumer, anc Gurevitch also commented that, although previews researches on
pratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people on the media, they did not address the
connections between these gratifications (Katz et al., P974a). They suggested that uses and eratifi-
eathons research concer with following aspects: “(1) the social and the psychological origins of (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) dif-
ferential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in (6) need gratification and (7) other
Consequences, pethape mostly unintended ones" (Katz etal, 1974b, p. 20). The studies of Karz and

his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of bailding the uses and gratifications approach. Since
