; 2 tigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classifications
in order to measure certain variables” (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled “Contents of Communication,"
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1546) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence that runs from control to content and from content
to audience” (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" (p. 44). Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the
remainder ot his Career.
