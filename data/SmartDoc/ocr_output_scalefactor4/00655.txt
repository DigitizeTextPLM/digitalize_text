I, NEEOS AND GRATIFICATIOWS

1 Needs and Gratifications

‘Uses and gratificabans aporoach emphasizes motives and the selt-perceived needs of audience mem-
bers. Blumiler and Ratz (1974) concluded that different people can use the sare communication mps-
sage for very different purpoies. The same media content may gratify different needs for different
individuals. There is not only one way that people uses media. Contrarily, there are ad marry reasons
for using the media as there are media ugers (Blumlor & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and
education, aMect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their
needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gretifications
for using different media. McQeuail, Bluenter, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-persan
interactions to classty four important media gratitications: (2) Diversion: escape from routine or
problernis; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; [2] Personal
entity: sel reference; reality exploration; value reirdorces: and (4) Surveillance (fonms of informa-

Another subdivided version of the audiences motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based
on 4 general theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitwe and
Affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passe” initiation, “extennal” wersuss
“intemal goal orientation, and emation stability of “grawth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 GMferent types of motivations which apply to media use [Figure 1}, Fapare 2. A
Shruciucing of 16 gereral paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Kate, Gurévitch and Haas

(1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
put them into fae categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring indormarian, browledge and understanding;
