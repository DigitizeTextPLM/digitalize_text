Five basic assumptions were stared in a study of Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 st fellows. ;
They provide a framework for understanding the carelation between media and audiences:

1. The audience is conceived a5 active, i.e., am important part of of mass media use is
assumed to be goal oriented ... pattems af media wee are shaped by more or less

definite expectations of what certain kinds of coment have to offer the audience
member,

2. Inthe mass communication process much initiative in linking need gratificanion and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a atromg limitation on
theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attinades and
behavice.

4. The media compete woth other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
mass communication constinee burt a segment of the wider range of human needs.

and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass noedia comsump-
tion cemainly varies.

4, Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual aediemce members themselves- ie, people
are sufficiently sell-aware to be able to repert their interests and notives iin

particular cases, or af lease te recognize them when condronted with hens in am
intelligible amd familiar verbal formulation.
