Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural linguistics.
To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation
by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized gat
of conventions necessary fo communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which compose
it, a5 opposed to it, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language” (Barthes, 1987,
p.13). Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level,
langue, is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized.
On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual lavel. However,

itis considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free fram the
shared convention, the structure, — -

* language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. tis the social part of
language, itis essentially a collective contract which one must accept in ats entirety if one
wishes to communicate. It is because a language ie a system of contractual values that it
resista the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social insti-

tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity thal f corresponds to and individual act and nol te a pune
creation, (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Saugurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept of meaning which is expressed through the fon.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, beth the word
dog in English of in Korean are the external forms expressing the aclsal animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes ihe signified. “| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concep! and sound-image respectively by signified (eignifia) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them fromm each ofher and from the whole of which they are parts” (Saussure, 1959, in FE. Innis
(ed.), p. 37). The correspondance of the concept'meaning to the extemal form is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable intemal relation but the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying sysiem. Saussure (1960) argues thal language does
not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from
within itself throwgh a series of conceptual and phonic differences". According to Saussure, "reaming
ig produeed through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagrriatic
(e.g, a sentence) and the paradigmatic (2.9. synonym), organized into a signifying system” (Barker,
2002, p. 29). Asa grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means 4 field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
game paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the follaw-
ing sentence: “| went to a theater with my gitifriend." This sentence is established through the
linear combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as | theater, my, and girlfriend can be
substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such a5 "She went to a restaurant with her mother.
Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us thal signs are operated only when
they are related to each other, “Crucially, signs do not make sense by virtue of reference to entities in
an independent object word; rather, they generate meaning by reference 10 each olher, Thus, mean
ing Is understood as a Social convention organized threwgh the relations between aigns (Barker, C.,
2002, p, 29). “tis central to Saussures argument that red is meaningful in relents bo the difference
between red, green, amber, atc. These signs are then organized int a sequence which generates
meaning through the cultural conventions of thelr usage within @ particular context.
