1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses.and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the-self-perceived needs of audience mem-
bers. Blunver and Katz (1974) concluded that diferent people can use the same communication mes-
sage for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different

individuals. There is not only one way that people uses media. Contrarily there are ag many reasons
for using the media ag there are media users (Aluenler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's backgraund, such as experience, interests, and
education, affect peaple’s ideas about what they want from media and whach média best meet thelr
needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own mobves and gratificatians
for using different media. McCluail, Blumer, and Brown (1972| proposed a model of “media-perion
interactions” ba dadsify four important media gratifications: [1] Diversion: escape fram rowtine ee
problems; emotional release: (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility: [3] Personal
identity: 464 reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance [forms of inferma-

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was sugpested by MoGuire (1974), based
on @ penerel theory of human needs. He distinguished between two types of needs: cogretive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive’ initiation, “external” wersus
“internal” goal orientation, ane emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 diferent types of motivations which apply to media use [Figure 1}. Figure 2. A
structuring of 16 general paradignes of human motivation [Motuire, 1974). katz, Gurevitch and Haas
(2973) developed 35 needs taken fram the social and paychodogical tumctions of the mass media and
put theen into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring intarmabon, trerwledge ard wrderstanding:
