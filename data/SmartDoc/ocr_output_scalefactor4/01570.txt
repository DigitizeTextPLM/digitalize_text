4 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry"

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culture industry outside of a German context, In the years since there have been numer-
aus criticisms of the text, mot least since Adamo made sweeping generalizations about “the
commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods” (Gook, 1985, p. 172). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cock, Adomo erred in not discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertiaing (Gook, 1506, p. 45)

For Terry Eagleton, both Adamo and Marcuse cveresiimated the dominant ideology, be
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all parvadive reification” (Eagieton,
1901. p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of derminant values and belets
among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play the reproduction of the ays
tem as a whole” (Eagleton. 187, p 38). Fredric Jameson painted oul that Adornc's idea
of a cure induslry was historically limited, singe the society ikat developed im the 19508
and 18706 with new media went beyond ihe cultural possibilities available during the 140s.
