Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theory. Information exchange is a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty, Diacer-
tainty Reduction teary (URT), accredited to Charles RB. Berger and Richard J. Calabrese (1975), recognized that
reduc ing uncertainty was a cent ral motive of communication. Through the development of WRT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research. Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of ihe motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 153). The Study of information is basic
te all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. WRT places the role of communication into the central
focus which was a key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1974) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories as starting points’ (p. 94)
The research underlying the theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of inter
personal communication research; ith the development of URT, communication researchers began to look to
communication for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social
SCLETRCES.

1.2 The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Traditionally, communication has been viewed as an interdisciplinary field, [ntermpersonal communication is
most often linked to studies into language, social cognition, and social psychology. Prior to the 19605, only a
modest amount of research wes completed wider the label of interpersonal communication. Heath and Firat
(2000) marked this time as the origin of the field of interpersonal communication: “Particularly since 1960,
scholars adopted communication a5 the central term because they warned fo stuay i ar a significcrent and wnigite
aspect of human behavior’ (p. 39). [The [bots produced research that impacted the development of an in-
terpersonal field. Research in psychiatry examined personality and the influence of relationships, finding that
psychiatric problems were not only a result of self problems, but a result of relational problems as well, Re-

search trends in humanistic psychology and existentialism inspired the idea that relationships could be improved
