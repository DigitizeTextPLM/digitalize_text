ae ything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or misa publicity and
clan LBernsya, 1955, p22). Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent a different view of
the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily
manipulated, Bernays cautions against this. He claims, The public & not an amorphous mast whith
Can ba molded at will or dictated to (Gernays, 1928, p. G6). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the hea
that in attempting bo influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial, It must explain itself, its aims, its abjectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing ta accept (p. 64).

Bernays elaborates on these: ideas in Public Relations (1052). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can be
used to combine the idess of the public and the perauader. The objective-minded public relations
man helpe his client adjust te the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust ta it (Bernays,
1952, p. 9). Bermays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps then
to understand the sockety of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint af others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade or suggest courses of action (p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation af
the public is still possible, it iz not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed dy Lippmann, Bosewell, Elid, and Bernays are tmportant for a mumber of
reasons. Bosed on fhe ideas of fie predecessors, Tippmann wos abies to bring attention fo the fact that
the public is able to be injiuericed by the media, The work of Lippmann and his colleagwes has fed to tore

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the direct effects wud United effects
media models. Theorista each as Ellul tended to sade heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
propagiunda could directly influence the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, theorists such a Lippmann
also noted that the mexlia might not be influencing only thought, but may alen be influencing what
people thought about, Tt was this line of thinking that resulted ist a starting point for future research
in the ares of the limited effects af the media. Such limited efects were shown through the work ab
Iyengar end Kinder, a8 well ae MeComba and Shaw, Qverall, the neearch af the scholars discussed in
this paper has been very important to the understanding of the media, the manipulation of the public,
and the formation af public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Laswell, Hernays, and Ellul
were formed pears ago, they continue to help us understand the society that surrounds us today.
