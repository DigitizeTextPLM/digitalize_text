Uses and Gratifications

1.1 Introduction

Uses and gratfications approach is an influential tradition im media research. The orginal
conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of
certain media contenis. The core question of such research is: Why do people use media
and whal do they use them for? (McQuail, 1983), There existe a basic idea in this approach:
audience members know media content, and which media they can use to meet thei needs.
In the mass communication prosess, uses and gratifications approach pula the function of
finking need gratificalions and media choice clearly on the side of audience members. It
suggests thal people's needs influence whal media they would choose, how they ube cer-
tain media and what gratifications the media give them, This approach differs from other
theoretical perspectives in that @ regards audiences as active media users as opposed to
passive receivers of information, In contrast to traditional media effects theanes which focus
on “whal media do to people” and assume audiences are hamogeneous, used and gratifica-
tions approach is more concerned with “what people do with media” (Mabe 1959). Ht allows
audiences personal needs to use media and responds to the media, which determined by
iheir social and payonoiogical background. Uses and gratificahons approach also poshulabes
ihat the media compete with olher ivfcemation sources for auckence’s need satisfaction (Katz
etal, 1974a). As traditional mass media and néw media conbnue to provide people with a
wile range of média plattonms and content, it is considered one of the mosl appropriate
perspectives for investigating why audianoes choose to be exposed fo deterent

The approach emphasizes audiences’ choice by aesessing their reasons for using
a certain media te the disregard of others, ag well as the vanous gravivications obtained
from the media, based on individual social and psychological requirements (Severin
4 Tankard, 1997). As a broader perspective among communication msearches, if pro-
vides a framework for understanding the processes by which media participants seek
information a content selectively, commonsurate with then needs and interests (Matt
etal, 1974a), Audience members then incorporate the contant to fulfil! their needs or
to satisfy their interests (Lowery & Mabila, 1953).
