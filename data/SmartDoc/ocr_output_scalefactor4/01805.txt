that in attempting to influence the public, a busines: must shucly what terms the arin aS
made amicable and mutually beneficial, It must explain itself, its sums, ite objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing te accept (p. G6). :
Bernaye elaborates on these ideas in Public Melations (1952). Rather than merely Ee irae to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that a We
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. The objective-minded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays,
1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he Tecugiizes the power of
society, but atill also claims that manipulation ef the public is possible. Hernaya (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exest leadership io modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade or sugeest courses of action (p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is till possible, it is mot in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as
Lipproann and Ellul tended to disagrees with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories deneioped by Cippmann, Laarwell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a nember of
recone. Hosed on the ideas of kis predecessors, Lippmann mas oble fo bring attention bo fhe fact that
the public is able to be infieenoed by fhe media. The work of Lippmann and his colleagues hes led to more
recent research that is meant to help understand the influence of the tiedia on the public. Through the
