Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural linguistics

To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation
by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set
of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which compose
it, as opposed to it, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language” (Barthes, 1967,
p.13). Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level,
lanque, is the social convention or value sh ared through a society which is stabilized and standardized.
On the contrary, parole is flexible because itis the actual expression at the individual level. However,

it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the
shared convention, the structure.

A lanquage is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. lt is the social part of
language, itis essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one

wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming fram a single individual and is consequently a social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which ig both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization, The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is
essentially a combinatve activity that it corresponds to and individual act and not to a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into twa parts, (he
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or mea ning which is expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier. which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "Il propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sou nd-image respectively by signified (signifé) and
signifier {significant), the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-

rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts” (Saussure (959, in BR. Innis

| fed_), p. 37). The correspondence of the conceptimeaning te the external form is nat in the destined

| relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is mot the inevitable intemal ralation but the differance
penvween the signs that operates the signifying syStern. Saussure (1960) argues that language does
not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, But constructs maaning from
| within itself through a series of conceptual and phontc differences". According ta Saussure, "meaning
is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along vo axes, the syntagmals
(e.g. 4 sentence) and the paradigmatic (¢.9., S¥M onmyma}, org anized into & sign fying system” (Barker,
“02, p. 20). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the pa radigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection ls alao regulated by the eon sensus of linguistic com munity
members. For an example of the Sy ntagmatic and the paradigm atic, lets consider the on
ing sentence: “| went to a theater with my girlfriend. his sentence is eatabliahed through the
| jinear combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as heater my, ame erate pak be
substituted far by oiher signs in the paradigmatic, such as "She wentic a restaurant with ies ed er.
hrough the Sy ntagmatic ane thee paradigmatic, au saure tells us that sig ng are operated only when

ha! gaan erat world; rather, they generic mea ning by refarenoe ta each other, Thus, meat

| Hs et ao). “tis central to Sauesures argument that red is meaningtul in relation 16 the differance
Potion red, grean, amber, etc. These signs are then organized into a sequence which generates
meaning through the cultural conventans of their usage within @ particular context
