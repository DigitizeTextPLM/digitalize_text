became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954 Adorno published an essay
entitled How to Look at Television that was the result of a study that had been done for the
Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner and others. Tn this essay Adorno
warned, rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed
of psychological control (Adorno, 2001a, p. 160). It was one of the few occasions in the 1950s
that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments
of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on oceasion attempt to reshape
his thought on the culture industry, For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseuda-culture
in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film,
Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition ta
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 131).

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as opposed ta
other writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 609). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Reitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
aifluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent [Alway, 1995, p. 83). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideclogy whuse main objectives were to
iaintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.

Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information an

of mass media could be differentiated from their Thanip
