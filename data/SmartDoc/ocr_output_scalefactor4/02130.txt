of the language with a view to éxpressing his personal thought. It is because Speech is

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the lanqu i

signified and the signifier, The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the fon.

The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, bath the word

signifier (significant); the last two terns have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1859. in R. Innis.
fed.), p. 37). The comespondence of the conceptimeaning to the extemal form is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. lis mo{ the inevitable intemal relation but the diferenoe
between ihe signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1980) argues that “language does
not reflect a preexistent and extemal reality of independant objects, but constructs meaning from
within itself through a series ef conceptual and phonic differences”. According to Saussure, "meaning
ig produced throwgh @ process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatc
(e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g. synonyms), organized info a signifying system" (Barker,
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
game paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets. consider the follow-
- "| went to a theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence is established thraugh the
