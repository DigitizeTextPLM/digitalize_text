1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The i 7

and fetighized character of all cultural goede” (Cook, 1998, p. 173). Par tre
generally sympathetic. Deboran Cook, Adome erred in not discussing ihe processes of cul
he produchon, and failed 1o examine the cullure industry's economic dependence on other

usiness sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1956, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, be-
heving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip cian all pervasive reification” (Eagleton,
4551, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominani values and bedets.
among oporessed peoples in society has some part to play in the rapeoduction of the sys-
jem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1981, p. 38). Fredic Jameson poinged out that Adanno's ides
of a quiture industry was historically lrniled, since the society frat developed in the 1550s
and 1970s with new media went beyord the cultural possibilities available during the 15408.
While the idea of the culbure indusiry can be delerded af a upatul theory for industnal soci-
elles between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendarl,
45045, p. 146-48). Thus, for a some critics, the value of the dea of the culbune industry would
appear to be metely historical, if they in fact comeeded that it had ary value al al

Thus for-soene critics modemist wares would be counteracting lorons against the domenant
ideology. As noted in the example af Orson Welles, however, 1 may be the case that the
dominant ideology Gan co-opt modernist works for ts own enda. The idea of the culture
industry has had an imparlance in efitical theory since its appearance in the 1540s, in thal
ig has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation to ideology, and
hence, sadety. Since Adorno made sweeping ganaralizations aout the impact of the culbure
industry, and since he did not aysiematically explore how the culture indusinry operated, i has
been generally easy lor some to deamniss the dea of a culture irvduscéry. IL is nonetheless Ene
