Like evany other ginucturalet acholars, Barihes was influeroed by Saussure structural linguistics.
To Saussure, the linguistic mechanam operates on ta levels, the systematic sysiem and the variation
by apeaking actors. The former is caled langue and the latter parcle. Langue is the sysleralited set
of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which compass
it as opposed bo #, speech [parole] is covers fe purely indnadual par of language” (Barthes, 1967,
p13). Barthes inierprets Saussures fireguistec ssyahern varthin tre social dimension. The structure level,

Fecusing on the systematic level Sa ueurre distinguishes the language syslem into two guarts, the
signified and the signifier, The signified is a conceplor maaning which s expressed frough the form.
Tre form is Galled the signifier, whieh & ihe external part of language. For exampe, bath the ward
dog if English or in Korean are the exiomal fore expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actus
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. I propose bo retain the word sign (signe) bo
