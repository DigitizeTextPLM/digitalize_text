defined as, "...the investi on eer

at nieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence that runs from control to content and from content

ta audience” (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" (p. B4). Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the
remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswe I] was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particu arly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating pi blic opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it. However, il ts still that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way of Viewing

the power of the media that is somewnat similar to Lippmann’s theories.

1.2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

Edward Bemays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays ( 28
