ths means se gratifications that mativate people te be attracted to certain media is almost as old as
empirical mass communication research Itself (MeQuail, 1983), Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such as sap operas and quizzes, as well
as daily newspaper (Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc,). In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium
itself [Katz et al., 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy thelr listeners with advice,
support, of occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1994; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was abo discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure ta the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satigfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratiicatians.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era, Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and pratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the moot well-known
and contributed greatly ta establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz 6 served both as a soceologist and as a communication researcher He received his Ph.D. in So-
ciology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963, During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. in the late 1960, invited by the Gayvernment of Israel, Kat? headed the task force charged
with the imtroduction of television broadcasting, This experience led te his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in Inisure, culture and communication from the 1970s tol590s (UPEMN, 2002). In

1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg Scheal at the University of PennsyhWwania, and also directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-ioctoral study.

Katz's mentor in Colunibia University is Paul Lazarsfeld, whois one of the pioneers of gratifications research.
be cooperating work produced Important outgrowths that Connie the concept of gratifications with the

Lnictional thean model. Later, Katz intreduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the

notion that people wie the media to thelr benefit. Ina study by Kate, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject
which is known as the uses and gratifications research were explored. They viewed the mass media as a ieee
by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people band the media ta
their needs mare readily than the modia overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973)

Along with colleague lay G. Blumer, Kate published a collection of essays on pratt Te :

use. They suggest that media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the user and

they have alternate choices to satisfy their need. (Bluenler & Kate 1974]. The
