ve basic assumptions were stated in a study of Katz, Blumier, and Gurevinch in 1974 as fallow
provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media and audiences:

1. The audience is conceived a5 active, ie, an important pat of of mass media use is
assumed to be goal oriented ... patterns of media use are shaped by more or less
definite expectations of whar certain kinds of consent have to offer the audience
member.

2. Inthe mass comomnication process mech initiative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on
theariving about any farn of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and
teehaviar.

4. The media compere with olber sources of need satisfaction The needs served by

In addition, Kar, Blumer, and Gurevitch also commenoed chat, alchoogh previous researches on

1) Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gravtificaiioes approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of aacience mem-
hess. Blunder and Katz (1974) conchaded thar different people can use ihe same communication mes
sag for very different purposes, The same onedia content may gratify different needs for differeni
individuals. There is not only one way that people wees media. Contrarily, there are as many peasors
for using the media os there are media users (Slumler & Katz, 1974).
