Rogers was born in Carroll, lowa in 1931. He earned his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D, degrees from Iowa
State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly,
in 1966, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea.

The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creats applications of diffu-
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously
mentioned, communication, Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was
suffering from kidney disease, He died on October 21, 2005.

According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu-
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption, The diffu-

sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 40%).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu-
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, $-M-C-R-E
(e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect), Ragers (1995) mentioned, “this $-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be

interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a Scrcial system, aie final ly
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ va rable
. a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
d (2) innovativeness: (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-

vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research nas attemmed fa explain the variate,
