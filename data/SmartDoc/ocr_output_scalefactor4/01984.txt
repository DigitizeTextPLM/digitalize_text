it; as opposed to il, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language { ee : ae
p.13). Barthes interpreis Saussures linguistic system within the soctal dimension. The st aaa =
langue, is the social convention of value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized.
On the contrary, parole is flexible because itis the actual expression at the individual level. bose
it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from
shared convertion, the siructure.

A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of
language, itis essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety ifone
wishes to communicate. Itis because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming fram a single individual and is consequently 8 social msti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code

of the language with a view te expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is

essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual act and not to a pure

creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sauaurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the
signified and the signifies. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English of in Korean are the extemal forme expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. “| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifid) and
signifier (significant); the last ten tenns have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
fates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts” (Saussure, 1969, in A. Innis
(ed.), p. 37). The correspondence of the conceptimeaning te the external form is not in the destined
retation, bul rather, in the arbitrary relation. tt ie mot the inevitable internal relation but the difference
between the signs thal operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that “language does
not reflect 2 pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from

within itself through a sere of conceptual and phonic differences". According to Saussure, “meaning
8 produced through @ process of selection and combination af signs along two axes, the eyniagmatic

(0.9. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.9.. synonyms), organized into a signifying system" (Harker,

2002, p. 29), As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the s'

‘i ynta
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that an
be replaced with one another, Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
Same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the follow.
