Like many other siructuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural linguistics.
To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the variation
by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the later parole. Langue is the systematized set
of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which compose
it: a8 opposed to it, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language" (Barthes, 1257,
p.13), Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level,
langue, isthe social convention or value shared through a soceety which i stabilized and standardized.
On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However,
it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the
shared convertion, the structure.

A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of
language, itis essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one:
wishes to communicate. itis because a language is a system of contractual valves that it
resists the modifications coming from a single individual ard is consequently a social ineti-
tution, In cantrast to language, which is both institubon and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code

of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual act and motto a pure
creation, (Barthes, 7957, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two paris, the
eégnified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the fonm.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English of in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. “| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates ihern from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis
fed), p. 37). The correspondence of the conceptimeaning to the estarmal form is net in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation, itis not the inevitable internal relation bul (he difference
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (7960) argues that “language dows:
not reflect a pre-exisiant and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from
within itself through a series of conceptual and phonic differences”. Acconding to Saussure, "meaning
is produced through a process of selection and combsnation of signs along Iwo axes, the syntagmatic
(e.g. a sentence} and the paradigmatic (2.9., synonyms), organized into a signifying system” (Barker,
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another, Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the follow-
ing sentence: "I went to a4 theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence is established through the
linear combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as | theater, my, and girlfriend can be
substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such as "She went to a restaurant with her mother.”
Throwgh the syntagmatic and ihe paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated only when
they are related to each other. "Crucially, signs do not make sense by virtue of reference to entities in
an independent object world; rather, they generate meaning by reference to Sach other. Thus, mean-
ing is understood as a social convention erganized through the relations between signs” (Barker, C.,
2002, p. 29). “It is central te Saussures argument that red is meaningful in relation to thee difference
between red, green, amber, etc. These signs are then organized into a sequence which generates
meaning through the cultural conventions of their usage within a particular context.
