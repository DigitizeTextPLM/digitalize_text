i GENESIS OF "THE CULTURE INDUSTRY"

1 Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

enka a unslerstarsd the creation of the ides of the culture industry as well as ils reception the cemcept can be
examined chronologically, from. its preconditions, thraugh its generation, to its subsequent impact, The idea of
the culture industry grows out of a concer with culture, is developed through insights into the mechanical re-
praduction of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not anly te papular music, but also te Hollywood
movies. That this is so grows out of a number af histarical contingencies.

Adore was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin
never received a degree that would allow hin to teach al a university, accanting ta Hannah Arendt, Adore
became in effect Benjamins only pupil. Agter Benjamin's death “it was Adomoe wha then introduced a rational-
ized version of his ideas into academic philosophy,” (Jager, 2004, p. 65-6}. The relationship with Benjamin had
an impact on the development of Adomos thought during this period. Returning to Frankfun, Adomo began
teaching at the Institute, Adorno Jost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Mazi
party. Horkheimer had already set up a brinch of the Institute in Geneva, Switrerland, and the Institute bezan
operating there. The Nazis rise to pawer not only meant that Adame lost his job and would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jorgen Habermas would later nate, the
Tact that labor mowenvenis were co-opted in the development of fascial regimes was one of the historical expe-
riences influencing the development of critical theary, the others being Staliniat repression and ihe production
of mass culture inthe United States (Morris, 20001, p, 48).

Adomo was a Oodord fram 1944 te 199%, where be worked on a manuscript on Husserl. He was considered
an outsider, newer integrating into the British academic mainstream, and be looked forward to joining his Frank-
furt School colleagues, many of whom had in the meantime moved te the United States. Already in the late
19305 Adomo evidenced litte hope for mass culture, As propoganda and entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adomo debated mass culture, since film amd radio became the bye most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “On the Fetish
Character in Musi and the Repression in Listening” (s in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art inthe Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhersl, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adome lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed Ina concert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adomo was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile miliew
impossible” (Adem, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura bay photograph or film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes teed bo class, to Adama, the aura of the original artwork was the:
essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or [dea- ta down of layers of imitations; to Adore, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity, The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adorno, In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who bod succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
lnstitute of Sovial Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in
New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, run by Paul Lazars=
feld, Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members af the Institute, accepted
the position, although he later claimed that he did not know what a “radio project” THs. For his part,
Lazarsfeld looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be an expert on wee Adome
wate for the Project's journal in 141, reiterating his position that radia wes only an image ofa live perior-
mance. In addition, he questianed the claim by the radio Industry that the medium was bringing serious music
