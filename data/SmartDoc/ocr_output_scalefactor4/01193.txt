11) Harold Laswell (1908-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lewewell was utedertaking empirical analyses of propaganda In
fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being writen by Lappmann himself
(Rengers, 1984).

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on
condecting both quantitative and quaiinative analyses of peopaganda, understanding th commence of propaganda,
aul discernmoring the elect of propaganda ce the mass audience (Rogers, 1944) Lasswell credited with crewing,
the mass communication procedure of comem analysis (Rogers, 1954), Generally, content analysis com be
defined as, "ths invedtigation of communication messapes by calegoricing message coment into classifications
in order bo measure certain variables” [Hogers, 1944) In an essay enceled “Casters of Communication,”
Lasswell (19-45) explains that a coment analysis shoukd lake into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear ina mexape, the direction im which the symbols ery to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By undertanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1546) aime to
achieve the goal of understanding the “scream of influence that cure from conerol to coment and from conient

This method of content analysis. i tied strongly bo Lavewell (1554) eaely detinition of communication which
stated, “Who says whar in which channel io whom and with what effects” (p. FA). Conpent analysis wasessen-

remainder of his career:

Aside from endersanding the coment of propaganda, Lacowell was alco inerested in how propaganda could
shape publicopinion. This dealt peimanily with undersanding the effects af dhe media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in tamining the feces of che media im creating public open wilhin a democratic system. In thes
way. Lasewell hes creaied a cycle, whereby the public is limied in the information that is presenoed eo them,
and also apprehensive to accept it, Horeever, it is anil that information then is affecting their decisions within

ihe democradc 2ysiem, and is being presented in them bby the government This isan interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar b> Ligpmana’s theories.

120 Edward Bernays (1091-1995)

AS appresimately the same time that Lippman and Lawiwell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Eiheard Bornays (1090-19) was examining public eelacons, propaganda, and public opinion, Bernas (1528)
defines propaganda as, a corisient, enduring effon wo creaie or shape evenis to iefheence the relations of a
