_ According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to‘

‘the process by which an innovation is commu-

sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” ip. 409),

{e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect), Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this S-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variable
is a very important factor, According to Rogers ( 1994), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption, Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research Aas atfeniyed to explain fhe variahies
