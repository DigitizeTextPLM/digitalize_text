1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of commu
nication, it would be beneficial to know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined
and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory, Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there
was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
also contributed to the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts ftom the
information theorists a5 well as Heider (1958) research in attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communic ation by defining uncertainty as
the “number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 100), The ee aE
