4 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

lit 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
ure industry outside of a German context. In the years since there have been numer-
ous criticisms of the text, not least since Adorno made sweeping gene ralizations about “the
commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the

generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cul-

tural production, and failed io examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1998, p. 49).
For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, be-
jieving that “capitalist society lanquishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton,
qagi, p. 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
among oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction af the s¥5-
tem as 4 whole” (Eagleton, 4991, p. 36). Frednc Jameson pointed oul that Adorno's idea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the {560s
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1940s.
While the idea of the culture industry can be defended a3 4 useful theory for industrial SOCI
eties between 4920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl

appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value at all.
