the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims ta
achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence that mans from contral ip content and from content
to audience” (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasawell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom asd with what effects" (p. $4) Content analysts was easen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Laswell went onto doa lot of work within this area dharing the
remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was aloo interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with udersianding the effect of che media. Lasewell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within & democratic system. [n this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it is still that information that is affecting their detisians within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government. This is an interesting way at viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories.
