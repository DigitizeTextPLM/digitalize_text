Berger (2005) states: “these eatly theoretical forays helped shape the interperscmal comm research
agenda during the past two decades" (Pp 416). Today, interpersonal communicarion tends to fore
an dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or commianication as
4 function of developing relaticeships. Research insa interpersonal communication theory typically
foouses on the development, mainiennce, and dissolution of relationships. It has been recornieed
that Interpersonal communication is motivated by uncenainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 15975}
Since Its Inteduction in the 1970s, uncenainty has been recognized as a major field af snocy that has

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty bas been idencified a5 an important consmuct, | sary to the study ed commu-

and studied. Ome way to ocomdider uncertainty is through the cheoretica) framework of information
theory. Shannos and Weaver (1949) proposed that unceralery existed ina given siraatiom when there
wat 4 high amount of possible aliermatives and the probability of their event wes relatively equal
Shannen and Weaver related this virw of uncertainty bo the (ransmission of messages, bur their work

infarmatkan theorists as well a3 Heider (1954) research in attribution, Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded che concept of uncertainty to fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty a
the “number of alsernative ways in which each interactant might behave” (p. LOD), The greater the
level of uncertainty that exists in 4 situation, the smaller the chance individaals will be at

that they do, Berger ape] Bradac’s (1962) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complesity of this
process when they stated: “Uncerainey, then, cam stem from the lange pumber of alemacive things
that a stranger can believe or patertially say" Uncertainty plays a significant — when examining,
