1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology atthe Univer

cw Tpersonal communication. After graduation, initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin death, Beaiterer
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
(samelson, 2000). Much of Pestinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed

stantial influence on the development of inte

Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging field of in-
lerpersonal communication and on the development of URT. Festinger is best known for the theories
of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison, Cognitive Dissonance theary (CDT) attempted to
explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed CDT
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). CDT allows for three
relationships to occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equi-
librium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each
other; and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another
(West & Turner, 2000). Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an clement of arousal and dis
comfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals lank to
feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the sell, the individual
usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to the self. This need He social Se
