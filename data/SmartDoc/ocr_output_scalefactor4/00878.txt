1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of commu-
Tiication, it would be beneficial to know when the comcept originated, and bow it has been defined
and studied, One way to consider uncemainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there
was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
also contributed to the development of UBT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the
information theorists as well as Heider (1956) research in atiribution. Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty te fit interpersonal communication by defining uncertainty as
the “number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 100). The greater the
level of uncertainty that exists in a situatlon, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to pre
dict behaviors and occurrences. During interactions individuals are not only faced with problems of
predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or beliewe in the way
that they do. Berger and Bradac’s (1982) definition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity of this
