1 Other Propaganda Theorists

Ll Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses of Lilie
fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann

ers, LOS4),

bie aie ak (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research, He focused on
conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content at propaganda,
and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasswell is credited with creating
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis can be
defined as, "_..the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classifications
in order to measure cemain variables" (Rogers, 1994), In an essay entitled "Contents of Communication,”
Lasewell (1546) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience's opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1946) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the "stream of influence that rans from control to content and fram content
to sudience” [p. 74].

This methine of content analysis i tied strongly to Lacswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, “Who says what in which channel ta whom and with what effects" (p. £4). Content analysis was essen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to doa lot of work within this area during the
temainder of his career,

Aside fram understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinian within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the pwolic is limited in the information chat i presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accepe it. However, it is still dat information that is affecting their decisions within

the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government, This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media than is somewhat similar to Lippmann's theories,

1.2) Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examini
Edward Bernays (1891-199) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bemays (1928)
