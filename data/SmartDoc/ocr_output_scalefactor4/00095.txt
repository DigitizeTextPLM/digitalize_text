I. OTHER PROPAGANDA THEORISTS

Other Propaganda Theorists

1.1 Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Lasswell was undertaking empirical analyses af propaga mia. In
fact, much of the propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actually being written by Lippmann himselt
(Rogers, 19944.

Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused i
conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda,
and discovering the etfect ot propaga nda on ee mass abdience | Rogers, | S441. Lasswell 15 credited ma Cred ung
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1954). Generally, content analysis cal kee
defined as, "...the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into chisaiacatans
in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled "Contents ai Communication,
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persiiade the audience's opinion, and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasewell (1546) ams to
achieve the geal of understanding the "stream of influence that runs fram control to content and from content
to audience” ip. #4)

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1953) early definition of communication which
stated, "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects" [p. B4). Content analysis was @55eM-

remainder of his career.

1.2 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bernays (1928)
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of a
public to an enterprise, idea, or group (Pp. 25).

that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public, [t can help individuals decide what to think
about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to society’s functioning as a whole.
Bermays Slates, “We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas sugpested, largely by
men we have never heard of... Yast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live
together as a smoothly functioning society [p. O).

Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be modified, and that such shaping is a necessary part of
society, Bernays pursued his work in the fleld of public relations. “Public relations is the attempt, by information,
persuasion, and adjustment, to engineer public support for an activity, cause, movement, or institution” (Bermays,
1955, p. 3). Inthe Engineering of Consent, Rernays (1955) lays out the framework for understanding the public
and developing a public relations campaign Bernays (1955) claims that the key to a successful public relations
campaign is adjustment of the campaign te the attitudes of various groups in society, gathering information
to effectively express an idea, and finally, utihzing persuasion to influence the public opinion in the intended
direction.

Bemays’ theories represent a step forward for mass communication theory. They move away from more
typical presentations of “hit-oremiss propaganda,” and move toward a deeper
