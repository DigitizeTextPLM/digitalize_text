Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived

In addition, Karz, Blamier, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previcws researches on
gratificariors detected diverse pratifications that attract people on the media, they did not address the

individaals. There is not only one way that people uses media. Cuntearily, (here are 45 CaMy reasons
