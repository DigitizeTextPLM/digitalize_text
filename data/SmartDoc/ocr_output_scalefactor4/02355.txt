on communication agrees with media's effects towards people. For example, a je! ofan meee
ory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, eel and infl uential
effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information inte the consciousness of the masses” (Watson & Hill 1997, p.
105}. Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 1920s to the 1940s, After that, a shift
which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses
and gratifications approach.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as
empirical mass communication research itself (McQuail, 1983). Dating back to the 19405, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such as soap operas and quizzes, a5 well
as daily newspaper (Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1444, 1949; Herzog, 144; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc.) In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium
itself (Katz et al., 1974b). For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy their listeners with advice,
support, of occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering

information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure to the dally routine [Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and as 4 communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in So-
ciology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-

sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work aieair
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s to1990s (UPENN, 2001), In

1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Sarapl ene P Ut letee emis

x Katz's mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsteld, whois one of the pioneers of gratifications research,

eir cooperating work produced important outgrowths that connect the concept of gratifications with the

functional theory model. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he pra t

notion that people use the media te their benefit. Im a study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas aes, with the
