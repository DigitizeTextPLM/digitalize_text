; ial Institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed
: psychological control (Adorno, 200La, p. 160). Tt was one of the few occasions in the 1950s

that Adorne would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it

strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments
of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape
his thought on the culture industry, For example, in 1859 he wrote of a universal pseudo-colture

in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the esay Transparencies on Film,
Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hobendabl, 1995, p. 141).

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematic context, as apposed to
ether writers in the Frankfurt School (Wiggershaus, 1994, p. G09). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced budustrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Heitz, 2000, p. 1d), Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent [Alway, 1995, Tp. 83). The
entirety of society had become organized around an ideology whose mitiet objectives were to
maintain social contre! and continue te perpetuate the ideology that maintained that comtral.
Echoing Adorno, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated fram their manipulation and indoctrination fanctlons
