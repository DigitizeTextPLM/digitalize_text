Its well accepted that communication theories have develo ped through the realms of psychology and so
eoret pied the past 100 years. With illumed by valuable ideas as well as exploring more untilled fields in these
two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding media. As a sub-tradition of
media effects research, uses and gratifications approach is suggested to be originally stemmed from a func.
tionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumer & Katz, 1974}, To some extent, however, functional th Bory
on communication agrees with media's effects towards people. For example, a model often used in the the
ory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential
effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information into the consciousness of the masses” (Watson & HIN 1997, p
105). Functional theory influenced studies on communication fram the 1920s to the 1940s, After that, a shift
which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led ta establishment of uses
and gratifications approach.

The exploration of gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as
empirical mass communication research itself (McQuail, 1983). Dating back to the 1940s, researchers became

interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such a3 soap operas and quizzes, as well
as dally newtpaper (Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949: Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; efc.). In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served elther by some specific content or by the medium
itself (Katz et al., 19746). For instance, radia soap operas were found to satisty their listeners with advice,
support, or occasions for emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term "gratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz is served both a5 a sociologist and as a communication researcher He received his Ph.D. in So
ciology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963, During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to Hi 5 subseq vent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s to1990s (UPEN N, cae ip
