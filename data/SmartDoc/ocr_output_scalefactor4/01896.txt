1). NEEDS AND GRATTFECATIONS

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study of Karz, Blumler, and Gurevieck in 1074 as follows,
‘They provide a framework for understanding the conelation between media ane) audiences:

1. The godience & conceived a active, i, an important part of of mass media use is
assumed to be goal oriented... patterns of media wee are shaped bye more or less
definite expectations of what certain londs of coment have to offer che aodbence

In the mass communication process mech initiative in linking need gratification amd
media choice lies with the gudience member. This places 4 strong limitation om

. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by

Mahodolegically speaking. many of the goals of mass media ase can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- Le., people

In ecklilion, Kate, Blumier, anc) Gurevich ao commented that. ahhough previous researches on
Bralifications detected diverse gracifications thar amract people on the media, they did not address che
connections between these gratifications (Katz et al, 1974ap. They suggested that uses and grarifi-

his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of balding the wes and gratification: approach. Since
then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended, The current statos of uses and

1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses and pratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience mem-
bers. Bluenler and Katz (1974) concluded thar different people can use ihe same COMmenunication tes-
sage for very different purposes, The same media coment may gratify differem needs for different
individuals. There is oot only one way that people uses media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons
for using the media as there ane mecha users (Blumer & Kate, 1574).

Basic needs, socal situation, aed ihe individual's background, such of experience, interests, and
education, affect praple’s idecs bow whet they want from media and whch media best meet their
needs. That i, audience members are aware of and cen state their own motes and gratifications
