oposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among

ations research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach,

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher He received his Ph.D. in So-
ciology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, Invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s to1990s (UPENN, 2001), In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and alzo directed its
experimental Scholars program tor post-doctoral study.

Katz's mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsteld, whois one of the pioneers of gratifications research.
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that conmect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theory model. Later, Katz intro duced wes and gratification approach when he cane up with the
notion that people use the media to their benefit. Ina study by Katz, abet and Haas (373), a subject
which is known as the uses and gratifications research were explored. They viewed the mass media as a means
idualé connect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to
n the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1972).
