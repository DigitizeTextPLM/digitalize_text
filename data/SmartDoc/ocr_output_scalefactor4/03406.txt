1. CRITICAL RESPONSE TO "THE CULTURE INDUSTRY"

He complained to the dean about the radical students in his classes who were making
teaching impossible. In the winter term of 1968-69 students occu pied a number of buildings
at the University at Frankfurt, including the Institute for Social Research. After the strike
ended, Adorno returned ta teaching, but his lectures continued to be disrupted, including

one “tasteless demonstration’ in which three females bared their breasts. Adomo died a few
months later (Jager, 2004, p. 201-08).

4 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culture industry outside of a German context. In the years since there have been numer-
ous criticisms of the text. not least since Adorno made sweeping generalizations about "the
commodified and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adorna erred in not discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1995, p. 48)

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the deminant ideology, be-
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton,
1991, p. 46), Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
amang oppressed peoples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys
tem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36). Fredric Jameson peinted out that Adorno's Wea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the 1960s
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1340s.
While the idea of the culture industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial soci-
elles behyeen 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness {Hahendahl,
1995, p. 146-48). Thus, fora some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry would
appear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded thal if had any value at all

Thus for some critics modernist works would be counteracting forces against the dominant
ideclogy. As noted in the example of Orson Welles, however, if may be the case that the
dominant ideology can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of the culture
indusiny has had an impartanee in critical theory since iS appearance in the 1840s, im that
ft has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation to ideology, and
hence, society. Since Adomo made sweeping generalizations about the impact of the culture
indusiny, and since he did net systematically explore how thee culture industry operated, it has
been ganerally easy for some to dismiss ihe idea of & culture indusiry. It is nanetheless tie
nase ihat motion pictures are still made by lange companies and thal their movies largely rely
on formulaic ploie. tt is also the case thal radia is increasingly controlled by & small number
ef companies, which tend to impose restrictions on how stations operate. As a broadcast
medium, television is very much related to both radia and film, and shares with them qualities
that situation tt in the culture indusiny. While there is a denacratizing aspect to the Internet
(in that anyore can create a web site), il happens that the commercial companies operating
on the internet continue to maintain an ide@ological function. For 6xanmple, ane seldom sees
new stories on MSNBC of Yahoo thal would quesiion the prerogatives of corporate America

4 rencamination of the idea of the culture indusiny may be necessary in order to theorize on
how mass communication media propagate dominant dechagies.
