Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural linguistios
To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the pinieg
by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systematized set
of conventions mecessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which compose
it; as opposed to it, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language" (Barthes, 1967,
p.13). Barthes interprets Saussure linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level,
langue, is he social convention or value shared through a society whieh Is stabilized and standardized.
On the contrary, parole is fewible because itis the actual expression at the individual level, However,

itis considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the
shared convention, the structure.

4 language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values, It ls the social part of
language, itis essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if one
wishes to communicate. Itis because a language is a syste of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and systam, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view te expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual act and motto 4 pure
creation. (Barthes, 1987, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language sysiem into two parts, the
signified and the signifier, The signified is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the fonm.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, both the word
dog in English or in Korean are the extemal forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. “| propose to retain the word sign (signe) te
designate the whole and to replace concept anc sound-image respectively by signified (signifia) and
signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 195%, in R. Innis
(ed.), p. 37). The correspondence of the conceptimeaning te the external farm is notin the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. tis not the inevitable internal relation but the differance
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that “language does
not reflect a preexistent and extemal reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from
within itself through 2 series of conceptual and phonic differences”. According te Saussure, "meaning

uced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic

(e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.9.. syranyms), enganized into a signifying system” (Barker,
2002, p. 29). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic erder, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
game paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, bets consider the follow-
ing sentence: “I went to a theater with my girlfriend." This sentence is established through the
linear combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as | theater, my, and girlinend can ne
substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, auch a3 "She went to a restaurant with her maiher.
Through the gyntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us that signs are operated only when
they are related to each othe, “Crucially, signs dé not make sense by virtue of reference to entities in

independent ebject world; rather, they generate meaning by reference ta each other, Thus, meairi-
