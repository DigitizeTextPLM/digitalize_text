culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything be had seen in

Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative

in Europe. The closest thing in Adornes experience to the advertising industry in the United States

was fascist propaganda [| r, 20M, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience with

the Princeton Radio esearch Project in the essay on the culture industry by moting the etatictical

division of consumers, and + I at he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political

propaganda (Horkhetimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). Ib became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did

agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adornos dissatisfaction with

the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further chesrelogs
the idea of the culture industry.

Because of the relationship between fhe Jrnstitnte for Social Research and Columita University,
Horkheimer, who fad already moved to California, could not bring Adorno to the West Coast until
Nevember 1840. When Adorno was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate commeuntty that
included Frits Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hons Bisler, Thomas ond Heinrich Mann, Alfred Doblin, and
Bertolt Brecht, seve af whick found work on the Fall od movie industry, The fact that Agorne

These preconditionsAdornes interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the
relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important to an understanding of

his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, poy culture on film and radio did mot bother to present itself as art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
fHorkheimer and Adorno, 2007, p, G6). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist

capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy {| Hohendahl,
1995, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adornowere the Hollywood production system, or
the OBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula eupplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
2002, p. 99). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system.
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorne, 2002, p.
106-7). Paradecdcally, any innovation would only reaffirm the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles
as an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would
allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it ite own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual
[Friedman, 1981, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
of social control [Horkheimer and Adore, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of economic
coercion ultimately meant the freedom to be the same (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 156)
high art, The
Culture Industry has been criticized as being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture
Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and
Adorno, 2002, p. LOL}. It was mot high art that Adorno was presenting as an alternative to the culture

industry, but modernism. Although he provides the idea of an opposing force to the culture industry,

Adorno provides no overt Marxist analysis. Instead, he notes in passing that the dominant system
utilized capacities for mass consumption for entertainment or amusement,

Since Adorna had been, in his ESSays ON Music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, The
Culture Industry has been criticized as being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture.
Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and
Adorno, 2002, p. 101).
