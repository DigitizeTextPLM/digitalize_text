society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public te possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important bexsavuse it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforte being mare by others,
and to persuade or suggest courses af action (p. I}. Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists euch 88
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories deseloped fy Lippmann, Dasrwell, EBiful, and Bernoys are important for o minober of
reasons. Goeed on the ideas of his predeccasors, Lippmann wey alle to bring attention to fhe fact that

The theories presented in this paper have tied hesvily ta both the direct effects and limited effects
media models. Theorists such az Ellul tended ta side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
propaganda could directly influence the thought of the masses, Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippmann
alee nobed that the media might oot be influencing only thought, but may alen be influencing what
people thought about. It was this ling of thinking that resulted in a starting point for future research
in the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work of
Tyengar and Binder, as well as MeCombs and Shaw, Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in
this paper ess been very important to the understanding af the media, the Manipulation af the publi
and the formation of public opinion. While the thearies of Lippanann, Lasswell, Bernays aa Stat
were formed years age, they continue to help us understand the society that surrounds ys today,
