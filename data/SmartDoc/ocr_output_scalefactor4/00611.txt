1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and tadio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn hecame an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkbeimer and Adorno. 2002, p. O65}. This business was based on what Adare referred to as Fordist
capitalise, im which mass production based on the techniques wed by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hubendabl,
O05, p. L42). Examples of thismot specified by Adanmowere the Hollywood production system, of
the CHS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based om formulas, and the formula aupplants the wark (Horkheimer and Adorno,

2002, p. 99). Mechanic reproduction ensured that there would not he any real change to the system,

and that nothing truly adversarial ta the aystem would emerge {Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, Dp.

106-7). Paradoxically, any ionevation would only tentiiem the system. and Adorno elted Orson Welles:
