Uncertainty Reduction

1.1 Advances in Interpersonal Communication; Charles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theary. Information exchange is a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Dimcer-
tainty Reduction theory (URT), accredited to Charles R. Berger amd Richard J. Calabrese (1975), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication. Through the development of URT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research. Heath and Bryant (2000) state; “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
ig the acquisition of information with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 153). The study of information is basic
to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
esearch in the field of interpersonal cammunication. WRT places the role of communication inte the central
focus which was 4 key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
communication process, they have tended to employ social psychological theories a5 starting points’ (p. SF).
The research underlying the theory and efforts made by ober contemporaries marked the emergence of inter
personal communication research; with the develapment of URT, communication researchers began to look bo

communication for theories of grenter understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social

1.2 The History of Interpersonal Communication Research: A Brief Overview

Traditionally, communication has been viewed a5 an interdisciplinary field. Interpersonal communicatian ix
meal often linked ta studies into language, soclal cognition, and social psychology. Proor to the 1960s, only a
nicest amount of research was completed under the label of interpersonal coomunecation. Heath and Bryarit
(2000) marked this time as the origin of the field of interpersonal communication: “Particularly since 1960,
scholars adopted communication as the central term because they wanted to stich if ay a sigtificont ana ange
