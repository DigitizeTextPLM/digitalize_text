1. THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in
Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative
in Europe. The closest thing in Adornos experience to the advertising industry in the United States
was fageist propaganda (Jager, 2004, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience with
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as being indistinguishable from political
propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). It became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did
not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adornos dissatisfaction with
the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to further develop
the idea of the culture industry.

Because of the relationship between the Institute for Sociol Research and Columbia University,
Horkheimer, who had already moved to California, could not bring Adorno to the West Coast unis
November 1947, When Adorno was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate community thot
included Frits Lang, Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Bisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred DÃ©blin, and
Bertolt Brecht, several of which found work in the Hollywood movie industry. The fact that Adorne
was part of this intellectual community whose members were involved in the production of Hollywood
moes must have hed some influence in developing his thoughts on culture, since the Hollywood system
inhibited the creative freedom that many of the expatriates had enjoyed in Weimar Germany.

These preconditionsAdornos interest in music, his friendship with Benjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, as well as involvement with the expatriate community in California and the

relationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important to an understanding of
his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. $5). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl,
1995, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adotnowere the Hollywood production sysbem, or
the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
2002, p. $9). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the system,
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge [Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p.
106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reafiirm the system, and Adorno cited Orson Welles
a8 an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would
allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual
(Friedman, 1981, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
of social control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of economic

coercion ultimately meant the freedom to be the same (Horkhelmer and Adorno, 2002, p. 136).

Since Adommo had been, in his essays on music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, The
Culture Industry has been criticized as being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture
Adorne specifically detines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and
Adorno, 2002, p. LOL). It was not high art that Adorno was presenting as an alternative to the culture
industry, but modertism. Although he provides the idea of an opposing force to the culture industry,
Adorno provides no overt Marxist analysis. Instead, he notes in passing that the dominant system
utilized capacities for mass consumption for entertainment or amusement,

Since Adorno had been, in his essays on music and radio, an apparent defender of high art, The
Culture Industry haa been criticized as being a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture.

Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkhelmer and
Adorno, 2M, p. 101).
