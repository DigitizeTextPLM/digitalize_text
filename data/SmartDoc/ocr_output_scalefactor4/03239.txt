in 1966, he worked on some family plinning communication project in Rores

The book has become the standard textbook om diffusion theory and it creats applications of diffu-
sion theory in such fields a4 geography, economics, paychology, political science, and, a5 previously
mentioned, communication, Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 200M because: he was
aiffering from kideey disease. He died on October 21, 2ihid.

According 10 Rogers (19065), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu-
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
isan ides, practice of object perceived as new by an individual or other unit af adoption, The diffs
sion of innovations invelves both mass media and interpersonal communscation charnets” (p. MS)
That is, by sharing communication chaseels such a3 inerpersonal comenunicaben of mass comenu-
nication people con get information of an inmovation ad perveive 16s innovation as useful. Laswell
(148) presented a well-known model of comenunication thal 1 analyzed as five paris, 5-M-C-B-E
fe.p., sender-message-channel-receiver-clfect), Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this S-M-0-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p 19). Specifically, (1) sinder
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new ides or procuact, (3) channels cam be
interpersonal ce mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and. fimally
(5) the effects can be individaal’s sdoption of social change. In the dalfusion theory, “Time” variable
isa very important factor, According to Rogers (155), time variable is involved im diffusscn in (L)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innowativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Mast inner

There are five differem ty dopters im the diffusion process, according bo Innovelivencss:
(1) Innovators (ventures 2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical) and (5) Laggands (traditionaly" (Rogers. 1995, pg. 183-185). Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual 1 relatively earlier im adopting new ideas than other
members af his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p, 40). Figure 1 siecrers the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innovativencss di their place on the adoption carve. Also, these cap i
