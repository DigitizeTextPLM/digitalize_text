ike other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural linguistics.
Ta Neaae Wa miavitls mechanism operates ontwo levels, the systematic system and the pimhispk
by speaking actors. The former ig called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the system
of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the eignal which coripose
it, as opposed to it, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language (Barthes, ie
p.13). Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimensian. The eset at
langue, is the social convention orvalue shared through a society which is stabilized and standa
On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However,
ais considered retatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the
shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. Itis the social part of
language, itis essentially a collective contract which ome must accept in its entirety if one
wishes to communicate. Itis because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications corning from a single individual and is consequently 8 social insti-
tution. In contrast fo language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought, lt is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that it comesponds to and individual act and mot te a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language systam ints two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified Is a concept or meaning which is expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, bath the ward
dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog, Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "| propose to retain the word sign (signe) fo
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified (signifié) and

signifier (significant); the last two terns have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
fates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts” (Saussure, 1959, in FR. Innis
(ed), pf. 37). The correspondence of the conceptimesning to the external form is not in the destined
nation, bul rather in the arbitrary relation, it ie met the inevitable internal relation but the difference
between the signs that operates the signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that “language does
net reflect & pre-exitent and extemal reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from
wathin ie thraugh @ series of conceptual and phonic differences’. According to Saussure, “meaning
i produced through @ process of sekection and combination of signe along two axes, the syntagmatic
(6.9. 2 sentence) and the paracigenatic (e.g., synonyms}, organized into a signifying system" (Barker
2002, 6 25). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the synta: i
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible ‘gre that eae
