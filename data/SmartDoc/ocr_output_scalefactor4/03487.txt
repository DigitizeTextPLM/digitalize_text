Pe soir ot gratifications that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is aimet ares
empirical mass communication research itself (hochuall, 1983}. Dating back to the 15405, researchers ‘
interested in the reasons for viewing different radia programmes, such as saap Operas and a ae i laa
as daily newspaper (Lazrsfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1548; #te.). In these:

itself (Katz et al., 2974b]. For instance, radio soap operas were found to satisfy thelr listeners with advice,
support, or accasions for emational release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was alo discovered to be important te give readers a sense of Security, shared topécs
of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berebon, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, piychologist Hertog [1544] marked them with the term “gratificatians.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevalling in the late 19503 dl 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Armong

and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received his Ph.D. in So-
chology in 2956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1963. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. Thit experience led to-his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s to 290s (UPENN, 2001). In
199, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and also directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Kates mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lavarsfeld, who is one ofthe pioneers of pratifications research,
Their cooperating work produced important outgrowths that commect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theary model. Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
notion that people use the media to their benefit. In a study by Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973), a subject
which is known ad the ues and gratifications research were explored, They wewed the mass media as ameans
by which Individuals connect or dconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to
their needs more readily than the media overpower them (Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973).

Along with colleague Jay G. lumber, Katz published a collection of stays on gratifications in LS74 which
wert entitled The Uses of Mass Communication. They took a more humanistic approach te looking at media
use. They suggest that media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the user and
they have alternate choices to satisfy their need. (Blumler & Katz, 1974). They also discovered that media
served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission for both
and individuals (Blumler and Katz, 1974). re society
