(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, §-M-C-R-E
(e.g., sender-mes sage-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this 5-M-C -R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Spectfically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be

(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or soctal change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variable
is a very Important factor. According ta Rogers (1995), Gime variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption, Kost inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research nas attempted to explain the variables
that influence how and why users and audience adopt a new information medium, such as the Internet.

theory nat only can apply to practical things, but also can be related to digital divide
There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innowativeness:
“1 Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate) (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, rp. 183-1 85) Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than othe
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure | shows the relationships fei ty ia
