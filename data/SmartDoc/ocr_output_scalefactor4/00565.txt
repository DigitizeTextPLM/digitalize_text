1 Return to Germany

ed without their permission in 1949, Horkheimer and Adorno protested, distancing
nau at a gee work, in order not to jeopardize their return to Germany. In the late
4 i nstitute relocated to Frankfurt, and opened in its new premises in 1941. Horkheimer
became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Frankfurt. In 1954 Aderne published an essay
entitled How ta Look at Television that was the result of a study that had been done for the
Hacker Foundation, with the involvement of George Gerbner and others, In this essay Adorno
warned, rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed
of psychological control (Adorno, 20(01a, p. 160), Tt was one of the few occasions in the 1950s
that Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture, At least one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of bis day did mot take part in cultural developments
af the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adore would nonetheless on occasion attempt to reshape
his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture
in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 19683 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 16, when writing the say Transparencies on Film,
Adormeo conceded that film-making might be an aceeptable cultural practice in opposition to
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hobendahl, 1994, p. 131).

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcuse put an analysis of late capitalist society into a systematle context, as opposed to
other writers in the Frankfurt School {Wiggershaus, 1994, p. 60). Instead of culture serving
ideological ends, for Marcuse social control mechanisms in advanced industrial society ensure
the wholesale integration of the individual into mass society (Heitz, 2000, p. 144). Capitalist
production and the tremendous wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
affluence that kept elements of society satisfied and quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 33), The
entirety of society bad become organized around an ideology whoeet tain objectives were to
maintain social control and continue to perpetuate the ideology that maintained that control.
Echoing Adormo, Marcuse wondered whether the information and entertainment aspects
of mass media could be differentiated from their manipulation aod indectrination fumctions
(Marcuse, 1801, p. &). However, it is difficult in Marcuses argument to separate culture
or mass media from society as a whole because Marcuse did not distinguish culture or mass
media as entities separate from the totality of dominant ideology in the same way that Adorno
bad done. In the end Marcuses analysis of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant
ideology. Marcuse wrote, "how can the administered individualswho have made thelr mutilation
into their own liberties and satisfactions, and thus reproduce it on an enlarged scaleliberate
themselves from themselves as well as from their masters? How is it even thinkable that the
vicious cirele be broken? (Marcuse, 1991, p. 251}. Given the pessimistic tone of the book,
it ig somewhat ironic that largely berause of it he would be perceived as an icon for leftist
movements of the 1960s in the U.S. and Germany that developed an oppositional stance,
In spite of this, Marcuse maintained that he was a philosopher, and not an activist, Like others
associated with the Frankfurt School, he was wary of the idea that theory could be translated
into practice (Chambers, 2004, p. 226).
= ae the text in 1961, Friedrich Pollack reported to Aderno and Horkheimer that the
work required too ruch revision to receive mass dissemination. The two authors continued to
negotiate with the Fischer publishing house until 1068, and may have only agreed to republish
the work since pirate copies had already been disseminated by individuals,
