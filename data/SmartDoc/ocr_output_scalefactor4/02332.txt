i, GENESIS OF “THE CULTURE INDUSTRE"

1 Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry as well as its reception the concept can be
examined chronologically, from its pre-conditians, through its generation, to its subsequent impact. The idea of
the culture industry grows out of a concer with culture, is developed through insights into the mechanical re-
production of culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to papular music, but alse to Hollywood
movies, That this is so grows out of anumber of historical contingencies.

Adomp was introduced to Walter Benjamin In 1923, and the two theorists became friends, Since Benjamin
never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorn
became in effect Benjamins only pupil. After Benjamin's death “it was Ademo who then introduced a rational-
ized version of his ideas ints academic philosophy.” (Mager, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Fenjamin had
an impact on the development of Adornas thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorn began
teaching at the Institute. Adorno Jost his right to teach in September 1933 duc to the rise 1 power of the Magi
party. Horkbeimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began
operating there. The Magis rise to pawer not only meant that Adomo lost his job and would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jorgen Habermas would later nate, thie:
fact that labor movernents were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe-
riences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48)

Adorno was at Oxford from 19940 1938, where be worked ona manuscript on Husserl, He was considered
an outsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he Inoked forward to joining his Frank-
furt School colleagues, many of whoen had in the meantime moved to the United States. Alreadhy in the late
1930s Adomo evidenced litte hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
193s, Benjamin and Adomo debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkharst, 1999, p. G2). A. pri-
mary problem fer Adomo lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a convert hall, symphonic works eculel
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adorno was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help ta make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adorno, 2001b, p. 47}. While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph of film
ae the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adorno, the aura of the original artwork was lhe
essential of the artistic authenticity. Te Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea- to down of layers of imitations; to Adem, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity, The gemeral attitude of the Fronkfum school
was that of Adorto, In 1938 Mux Morkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working im
New York, obtained a position for Adorno at the Princeton Radio Research Project, run by Paul Lazars-
feld. Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the bopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although he later claimed that he did not know what a “radio project” was. For his part,
Lazarsfeld looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be am expert on music, Adora
wrate for the Project's journal in 141, reiterating his position that radio was only an image of a live perfor-
mance, In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio industry that the medium was bringing serious muosic
to the masses (Wipgershaus, 1994, p. 243), While working al the Princeton Radio Research Project Adomo
became shocked at the degree to which culture had become commercialized in the United States.

Adore was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin
fever received a degree that would allow him to teach af a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adame
became in effect Benjamins only pupil. After Benjamin's death “it was Adomo who then introduced a rational-
ized version of his ideas inta academic philosophy.” (lager, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had
an impact on the development of Adormmos thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began
teaching at the Institute. Adorno lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi
party, Horkhelmer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the [nstitute began
operating there.
