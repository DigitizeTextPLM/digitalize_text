i. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study of Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows.
They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media and audiences:

1. The audience is conceived as active, Le., an important part of of mass mundia use 15
assumed to be goal oriented ... pattems of media use are shaped by more or less
definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience
meniber.

2. Inthe mass communication process much initiative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on
theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and
behavior,

3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
mass Communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs,
and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consump-
tion certainly varies.

4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- ic, people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in

particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation,

5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms. (p. 15-17),

In addition, Katz, Blumer, and Gurevitch also commented that, although Us research
gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people on the meclia, ee mat aimee
connections between these gratifications (Katz et al, 1974a). They Suggested that uses and gratifi-
cations research concer with following aspects: "(1) the Social and the peychological origins of (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) dif-
ferential exposure (or engaping in other activities), resulting in (5) need gratification and (7) other
consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones” (Karz. et al., 1974h, p. 20). The studies of Karz and
fis colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the uses and #ratifications approach. Sin
then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The current status of me
pratifications is still based on Katz's first analysis, particularl ie
