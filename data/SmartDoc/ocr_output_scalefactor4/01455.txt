(Rogers, 1334).

Harold Lasrwell (1902-1578) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda peetanch. He docesed on
conducting both quantitative ard qualitalive analyses of propaganda, undersdacding the coment of propaganda,
and discovering the elect of propaganda on the mins audience (Rogers, 1994). Lasewell is credited with creating

This method ed commer analysis is Ged strongly oo Lanewell (1945) early definition of commanication which

Aside from understanding the content of peopagamda, Lasswell was also interested in how propayanila could

Fused an cheese ideas that the public opinion can be modefied, and that such shaping is a necessary part of
