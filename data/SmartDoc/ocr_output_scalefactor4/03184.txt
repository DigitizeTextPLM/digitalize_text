(1948) presented a well-known model ot communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-C-R-E
(e.g., sender-message-chann el-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mertioned, “this S-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3} channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, “Time” variable
is a very important factor, According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted to explain the variables
that influence how and why users and audience aaopt a new information medium, such as the Internet,
decording to evolution of media fechnalagy, interpersonal influences are inportanl even though in the

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
