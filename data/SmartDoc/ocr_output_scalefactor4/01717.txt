Like many other structuraist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural linguistics.
To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operales on hwo levels, the systematic system and the variation
by speaking actors. The former i called langue and the latter parole. Langa is the aystematized set
of conventions neceasary to communication, indifferent to the mabetial of the signal which compoae
i; ap oppoded to i, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language” (Barthes, 1887,
p13) Barthes interprets Saussure linguistic syshem within the social dimenseon. The sinucture level,
langue, i6 the social convention of value shared through a eockety which is stabilized and standardized.
Cn the contrary, parole is flexible because it ig the actual expresdion at the individual lewel However,
