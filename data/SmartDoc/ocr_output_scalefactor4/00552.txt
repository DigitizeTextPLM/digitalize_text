The following theorists signi : fs
The A S08 significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication.

eof their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)
iit ptosis studied peychology atthe University oflowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,
cr h ounders of social peycholomy and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a sub-
staritial influence on the development of interpersonal communication, After graduation, initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
(Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin’s theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging field of in-
terpersonal communication and on the development of URT. Festinger is best known for the theories
of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theary (CDT) attempted to
explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed CDT
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982), COT allows for three
relationships to occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equi-
librium with each other: a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with cach
other: and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another
(West & Turner, 2000). Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an clement of arousal and dis-
comfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to
feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual
usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to the self. This need Ue gE SEE ree Lo
result in conformity pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, 2004). Berger and Calabrese (1973) related aa
cial comparison to URT by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons seck out similar oe
their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation” (p. 107). Festinger pert Saad Saree nee
Scientist award of the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished sca tatampat
ward from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger's legucy is Stgniticarl,
hi theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research. Aronson Le
Festin er, (980) stated, “It was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed his ty a
pare djesonance, and in my opinion, social psychology has not been the same since” (p. 2).
