1 Early Influences

The following theorists significantly coetributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication.
The influence of their work can be: seen reflected in the axsumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

11) Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of lowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,
one of the founders of socal payehology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a sub-
stantial influence on the developencea of interpersonal communication, After graduation, initially
workel al tke University of Reckester, hut in 1944 he followed Lawin to Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics, After Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the Lniversity of Michigan, Stanford University, and the Mew School for Social Research
(Samneleon, 2000) Much of Pestieger's research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin’s theories, Several of Festinger theocies were highly infleential on the emerging field of m-
terperscenal communication and on the developement af WRT, Festinger is best kmcun fer the theorees
of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Compansan Cognitive Dessonamce theory (COT) attempend to
explain how an imbalance acing cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed CDT
in has observations regarding attinade change in small groups (Festinger, (982). CDT allows for three
relationships io occur among cognitions: a comenant pelaticeship, in which cognitions are in equi-
libelues with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competicion with each
other; and an irrelevant relationship, is which the cognilions in question have no effect on one another
(West & Turner, 2000). Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of arvusal and dis-
comfort that individuals ack W reduce. Social Comparison theary postulates that individuals book to
feedback fram others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual
usally seeks che opinions of others who are similar to the self, This need for social consparison con
result in conformity pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, 21014). Berger and Calabrese (1973) related so-
cial comparison to UAT by stating that “Festinger bas suggested that persons scek oul senilar others
who are proimate when they experience a high bevel of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of
their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation” (p. 107), Festinger received the Deatinguished
Sebentist award of the American Psychological Assecirion and the Dastmguished Seniog Scientis’
Awand from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger’s legacy is significame, and
his theoretical influence can still be recegeazed in contemporary social scenes peecarch. Aronson (in
Festinger, (980) stated, “It wos in this ora that Leon Festinger invented and developed his theory of
cognitive disscmanoe, ard in my opinion, social paychology has not been the same since” (p, 7).

and Kort Lewla Heider, like Festinger, recognized Lewin as o substantial impact on his life: “| wane
