it is well accepted that communication theories have developed through the realms of psychology and so-
cinlogy over the past 100 years. With illumed by valuable ideas as well as exploring more untilled fields in these
two disciplines, researchers elicit a series of higher conceptions of understanding media. Asa sub-tradition of
media effects research, uses and gratifications approach is suggested to be originally stemmed from a func-
tionalist paradigm in the social sciences (Blumer & Katz, 1974). To some extent, however, functional theory
an communication agrees with media's eects towards people. Far example, a model often used in the the-
ory, the Hypodermic Syringe model, discusses that “the mass media have a direct, immediate and influential
effect upon audiences by ‘injecting’ information into the consciousness of the masses” (Watson & Hill 1997, p.
105). Functional theory influenced studies on communication from the 19205 to the 1940s. After that, a shift
which rediscovered the relationship between media and people occurred and led to establishment of uses
and grattications approach.

The exploration of gratificatians that motivate people to be attracted to certain media is almost as old as
empirical mass communication research itself [MoQuail, 1984). Dating back to the 19405, researchers became
interested in the reasons for viewing different radio programmes, such as soap operas and quizzes, as well
as daily newspaper [Larrfeld & Stanton, 1944, 1949; Herzog, 1944; Warner & Henry, 1948; etc.). In these
studies, researchers discovered a list of functions served either by some specific content or by the medium
itself (Katz et al., 1974). For instance, radio soap operas were found to catisty their listeners with advice,
support, or occasions far emotional release (Herzog, 1944; Warner and Henry, 1948); rather than just offering
information, newspaper was also discovered to be important to give readers a sense of security, shared topics
of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “gratiications”

Uses and gratifications aparoach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 19705 when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the group of scholars whe focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greath to establishing the structure of the approach.

Elthu Katz is served both as a sociologist and a3 2 communication researcher He received his Ph.D. in So-
cielogy in 1956 from Columbla University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1962. During
the mext thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem. In the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led to his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 1970s tol Sis (UPENM, 2001). In
1992, he joined the faculty of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, and ake directed its
experimental Scholars program for post-doctoral study.

Katz's mentor in Columbia University is Paul Lazarsteld, who ls ane ofthe pioneers of gratifications research.
Thalr cooperating work produced important outgrowths that conmect the concept of gratifications with the
functional theory model, Later, Katz introduced uses and gratification approach when he came up with the
nation that people use the media to thelr benetit. Ina study by Kate, Gureviteh and Haas (1973), a subject
which i known as the uses and gratifications research were explored. They wewed the mass media as a means
by which individuals conmect or disconnect themselves with others and found that people bend the media to
their needs more readily than the media oveqpawer them (Katz, Gurevitch and Haas, 1973).

Along with collaague Jay G. Blumer, Kate published a collection of essays on gratifications in 1974 which
were entitled The Uses of blass Communication. They teas a more humanistic approach to looking at media
use, They suggest that media users seek out a medium source that best fulfills the needs of the user and
they have alternate choices to satisfy their need. (Blumler & Kate, 1974). They also discovered that media
served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission far both society
and individuals (Blumer and Katz, 1974).
