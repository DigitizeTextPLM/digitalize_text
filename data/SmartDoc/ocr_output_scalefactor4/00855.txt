behavior.

The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
mass Communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of hurnan needs,
and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consump-

» Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- ie., people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and mvotives in
particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation,

. Yalue judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms, (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumer, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous researches on
eratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people on the media, they did not address the
connections between these gratifications (Katz et al., 197da). They suggested that uses and gratifi-
catiens research concern with following aspects: “(1) the social and the psychological origins of (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) dif-
ferential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in (6) need gratification and (7) other
consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones” (Ratz ef al., 1974b, p. 20), The studies of Katz and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the uses and gratifications approach. Simos
then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. ‘The current status af uses and
gratifications is stl) hased on Kate's first analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in
such an electronic information age when people have more options of media use.
