CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public, and the necessity of attention-generanneg wropaganda in influencing

public opinion (Hernays, 1956, p22). Bernays (1955) himself made a statement! regarding his phrase,
the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more

than anything else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss publicity and

propaganda (Bernays, 1985, p.22). Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent & different view of

the formation of public opinion. In opposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily
manipulated, Bernayvs cautions against this. He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which
can be molded at will or dictated to [Bermnays, L928, p 66). Instead, Bernaye (1925 | offer√© the idea
that in ateernpting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be

le amicable and mutually beneficial. It must explain iteclf, its sums, its objectives, to the
public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept |p 5}

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952) Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernaye presente public relations a5 4 teal that can be
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader. Uhe ob jective-mitnded public relations
man helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, oF helps the public adjust to it |Hernays,
1952, p. 9). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, a4 he recognizes the power of
socteby, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations. To citizens in general, public relations ts important because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by at hers,
and to persuade or suggest courses of action (p. 10). Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still posible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as

Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

The theories presented in thie paper have tied heavily to both the direct effects and limited effects
media modele. Theorists such as Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct eects model, whereby
propagarida could directly influence the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippmann
aleo noted that the media might not be influencing only thought, but may also be influencing what
neople thought about. It was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting point for future research
in the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work of
Iyengar and Kinder, aa well as McCombs and Shaw, Overall, the research of the scholars discussed in
thie paper has been very important to the understanding of the media, the manipulation of the public
and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul

were formed years ago, they continue to help us understand the society that surrounds us today.
