benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because It helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
and to persuade or suggest courses of action [p. Lf). Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed fy Lippmann, Losawell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a number of
feacons. Based on the ideas of hie predecessors, Dippmonn was able to bring attention to the fact thot
the public ie able to be influenced by the media, The work of Dippmonn ond hts colleagues has led to more
recent research that is meant to help understand fhe influence of the medic on the public. Through the
work Iyengar and Kinder, White, Gewin, and MeCombs and Shaw, a more comprehensive understanding
of the media fos been developed. The public has now been made aware voertous media functions such as
agénda-setting, gatekeeping, and priming, and the potential effects Whol these techniques can heave on
fheir audiences,

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the direct effects and limited effects
media models, ‘Theorists such as Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
Propaganda could directly influence the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippmann
also noted that the media might not be influencing only thought, hut may also be influencing what
people thought about. Tt was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting point for future eh
in the area of the limited elfects of the media. Such limited effects were shawn through the work of
Tyengar and Kinder, as well as McCombs and Shaw. Overall, the research of the scholars dj ed j
this paper has been very important to the understanding of the media, the inanipulati a
and the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Li ton of the public,
