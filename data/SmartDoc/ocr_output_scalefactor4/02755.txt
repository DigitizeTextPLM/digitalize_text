1, THE CULTURE INDUSTRY: ENLIGHTENMENT AS MASS DECEPTION

Commercialization of culture in the United States had gone far beyond anything he had seen in
Europe. Further, the prevalence of advertising in the United States was something with no correlative
in Europe. The clogest thing in Adornos experience to the advertising industry in the United States
was fascist propaganda (Jiger, 2004, p. 122). Adorno was later to allude to his experience with
the Princeton Radio Research Project in the essay on the culture industry by noting the statistical
division of consumers, and stating that he saw this research as belng indistinguishable from political
propaganda (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 97). Tt became obvious that Lazarsfeld and Adorno did
not agree on the value of empirical studies, and Adorno left the project. Adormos dissatisfaction with
the work of the Princeton Radio Research Project would eventually motivate him to farther develop
the idea of the culture industry.

Feoouse of the relotionahin between the Institute for Social Research and Columbia University,
Horkheimer, who bod already moved to California, could nat bring Adorno to the Weat Coast ant
Nowember 290. When Adorno was finally able to relocate, he joined an expatriate community that
included Frite Long, Arnold Schoenberg, Mons Eisler, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Alfred DÃ©biin, and
Bertolt Brecht, sereral of enbich found work in the Holijaood mowe industry The foc! Mat Adorno
wer port of thie intellectual community whose members were invelned in the production af Hollywood

inhibited the creatine freedom that many of the expatriates Aad enjoyed in Weimar Germany.

These preconditionsAdernes interest in music, his friendship with Eenjamin, and his work on the
Princeton Radio Project, as well os involvement with the expatriate community in California and the
Telationship of several of these to the Hollywood film industryare all important ta an wuderstanding of
his concern for the idea of the culture industry.

1) The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself ac art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 95), This bushwecs was based on what Adar referred to as Fordist
capitalism, in whith muss production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy [Hohendahl,
1505, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adotnowere the Hollywood production system, or
the CHS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Aadio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based om formulas, and the formula supplanta the work (Horkheimer and Adorno,
0G, p. $9). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would nob be any real change to the system,
and that nothing truly adversarial te the system would emerge (Horkbeimer ond Adorno, 2002, p.
106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reaftirm the system, and Adorno cited Crean Welles
af an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system weld
allow it to assume the stance of any apposition and make it its own, ulthmately rendering it ineAectual
[Frieiman, 1881, p. 166), Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry wis an instrument
af social contre! (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of economic
coercion whimately meant the freedom to be the game (Horkheamer and Adorno, anne, p. 136).

Si Adorno had been. in bei apparent of high act, The
Cult ndustry has been crit ine i Tt ,
Adorno specifically detines avant-garde art as the adversary of the Sia fodusicy (Horkheimer and
Adorn, 2002, p. DL). [t was not high art that Adorno was presenting as an alternative to the calture:
imiustry, but imternicm. Although he provides the hiea of an opposing force te the culture industry,
Adorno provides na overt Marxist analysis. Instead, he notes in passing that the dominant system
Willized capacities for mass consumption for entertainment or amusement,

Since Adorno had been, in his essays on music and radio, &n apparent defender of high art, The
Culture Industry las been criticized as belng a defense of high art, as opposed to popular culture.
Adorno specifically defines avant-garde art as the adversary of the culture industry (Horkheimer and
Adorno, 2002, p. LOL},
