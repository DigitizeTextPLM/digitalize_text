Uses and Gratifications

4.1 Introduction
Uses and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media research, The original
laining the great appeal of

conception of the approach was c
certain media contents. The core qu Why do people use media
and what de they use them for? (McQuail, 1983}, Thare exists a basic idea in this approach:

audience members know media content, and which media they can use to meet their needs.

In the mass communication process, uses and gratifications approach puts the function of
linking need gratifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience members. It
suggests that people's needs influence what media they would choose, how they use cer
tain media and what gratifications the media give them. This approach differs fram other
theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences as active media users as opposed to
passive receivers of information, In contrast to traditional media effects theories which focus
on “what madia do to people” and assure audiences are homogeneous, Uses and gratifica-
tions approach is more concerned with “what people da with media” (Katz, 1959). It allows
audiences personal needs to use media and responds ta the media, which determined by
their social and psychological background. Uses and gratifications approach also postulates
that the media compete with other information sources for audience's need satisfaction (Katz
et al,, 1974a). As traditional mass media and new media continue to provide people with a
wide range of media platforms and content, it is considered one of the most appropriate
perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be exposed te different.

The approach emphasizes audiences’ choice by assessing their reasons for using
acertain media to the disregard of others, as well as the various gratifications obtained
from the media, based on individual social and psychological requirements (Severin
& Tankard, 1997). As a broader perspective among communication researches, it pro-
vides a framework for understanding the processes by which media participants sook
information or content selectively, commensurate with their needs and interests (Katz
eft al, 1974a). Audience members then incorporate the content to fulfill their needs
to satisfy thelr interests (Lowery & Nabila, 1983), a
