Rogers was bom in Carrall, lowa in 1931, He camed his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from lowa
State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly,
in 1966, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea.

The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creats applications of diffu
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously
mentioned, communication, Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was

suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005.
According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu-
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system, An Innovation
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu-
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation a3 useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, 5-M-C-R-E
(e.g,, sender-message-channel-receiver-effect), Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this S-M-C-R-E oommu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
ean be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variable
is a very important factor, According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innovation-desision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption, Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion mesearch hes attempted fo explain the variables
that influence how and why users and audience adopt a new information medium, such as the Internet.
decording to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even fhougn in the
past the individual iv usually the ait ef analysis. Also, critical mass becomes an important facta ir
adopting new media hecawse mew media are interactive tools and thus are required by many wsers to
gain efficiency, That ix, the more people use, the more people get benefits. In this sense, diffusion
theory net only con apply te practical things, Gut also can be related te digital divide,
There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
“(1) Innovators (venturesome}, (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Lageards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185). Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively carlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure | shows the relationships between hpes

of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these categories

follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped. Source by wow? gsu.edu/wearwithidocs dif

fusion! Figure 2 shows that an innovation would spread through society over various periods of time in

a S-shaped curve. However, as noted above, different types of innovations (c.g., the rate of tetracycline

adoption is faster than that of the hybrid seed com) can have their own different rates in diffusion, Fig-

cept html When it comes to the process of innovation-decisions, Rogers (1995) mentioned that

there are five stages.

|. Knowledge + or — (selective exposure or awareness of news)

2. Attitudes + or — (people hove positive or negative attitude toward innovations)
3. Adoption (Decision): people decide to adopt the innovation

4. Implementation (regular or standard practice)

3, Confinmation (comparing and evaluating)
