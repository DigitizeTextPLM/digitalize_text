oe ding to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process bay which an pia ed eae
nicated through certain channels over time among the members ofa social aystem. An aaa
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other pa of aa ” ; 409
sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 403):
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass ee
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lass
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-C-R-E
(e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers [ 1995) mentioned, “this S-M-C-RB-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variable
is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
| the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inna-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research hos attempted to explain the variables
that influence how and why users and audience adopt anew information medium, such as the Internet.
| According to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even though in the
past the individual is usually the unit of analysis. Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in
So adopting new media because new media are interactive tools and thus are required by many users to
gain efficiency, That is, the mare people use, the more people get benefits. In this sense, diffusion
) theory not only can apply fo practical things, but also can be related to digital divide.
There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
| “(L) Innowators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (3) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp, 183-185). Rogersdefined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p, 40), Figure | shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve, Also, these categories
follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped. Source by www2.gsu.edu/"wwwitr/docs/dif-
fusion!’ Figure 2 shows that an innovation would spread through society over various periods of time in
a5-shaped curve. However, as noted above, different types of innovations (e.g., the rate of tetracycline
adoption is faster than that of the hybrid seed com) can have their own different rates in diffusion, Fig-

cept'02.html When it comes to the ‘ , a :
iekuriaeee process of Innovation-decisions, Ragers (1995) mentioned that

1. Knowledge + or — (selective exposure or awareness of news)
2. Attitudes + or — (people have posilive or negative attitude toward innovations)
4. Adoption (Decision): people decide to adopt the innovation

4. Implementation (regular or standard practice)

3. Contirmation (comparing and evaluating)
