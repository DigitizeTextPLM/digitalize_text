Leon Festinger shadied psychology at the University eflows under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,
one of the founders of social psychology and a paoneer in the research of group dynamics, had a sub-
stewiel influence on the development of interpersonal comminicotion. After gradualien, initially
worked at the University of Rockester, but in IMS he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Techmology and the Besearch Center for Group Dynamics, After Lewin death, Pestinger
worked at the Lniversity of Michigan. Stanford University, and the Mew School for Soctal Research

Lewin's theories, Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging fheld of ime
lerpersonal communication amd on the developement of WRT Festinger is best known for the theories
of Cogm tive Dissonance and Socel Compara Cognitive (hesonamce theory (CUT) aitempbed im

in hs observarionss regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 182). COT allows for three
relationships to occur ame cognations: a concent relationship, in whach cognitions are im equi-
librium ‘with cack ther, a dissonant relationship. in which cognitions are in competition wrth each

feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual
Wiually seeks the opinions of others whi are saenilar bo lhe self, This need for social comparison can
result in comformity pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, 2M) Berger and Calabrese (1975) relaped so
cal comparison to LRT by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons seek cut similar others
who are proncimate when they esperenoe a high bevel of uncertainty regarding the agproprigteness: of
their bebavior and/or opineons ima partiqular situation” (p, M7). Festinger received the Distinguished
Scientia award of the American Prychological Association aad the Distinguished Senior Scientist
Award from the Society of Experimental Social Peychology. Pestinger’s legacy is significant, and
his theonctical influence can still be recognized in comtemporary social sclemce research. Aronsan fin
