1, EARLY INFLUENCES

Therefore uncertainty is a concept that plays a significant role in interpersonal communication,

The following theorists explore how communication can be a vehicle individuals utilize to reduce
uneertainly.

1 Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in communication.
The influence of their work can be seen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology atthe University of lowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin, Lewin,
one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of growp dynamics, had a sub-
stantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication, After graduation, initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamies. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
(Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger's research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging field of in-
| communication and on the development of URT, Festinger is best known for the theenries
of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison, Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted to
explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed CDT
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). CDT allows for three
relationships to occur among copnitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions arc in equi-
librium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cegnitions are in competition with each
other, and an irrelevant relationship, in which the coumitions in question have no effect on one another
(West & Turner, 2000). Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an clement of arousal and dis-
comfort that individuals geck to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to
feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities, To evaluate the self, the individual
usually seeks tne opinions of others who are similar to the self, This necd far social companson can
result in conformity pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, 2004). Berger and Calabrese (1975) related 5
cial comparison t LRT bey stating, that “Festinger has suggested that persons sek out similar others
who are proximate when they experience 4 high level of uncertainty regarding the appropristenss! of
their behavier and/or opinions ina particular situation™ {p. 107). Festinger received the Distinguished
Schentist award of the Acmerican Psychological Association and the Distinguished Senior Scientist
Award from the Society af Experimental Social Psychology. Festinger = legacy is significant, and
his theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary gocial science research. Aronson cin
Festinger, 1980) stated, “tt was in this era that Leon Festinger invented and developed ins theary ad
cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, social paychelogy has not been the same Sines” (p. 3).
