, ch eeTs, There is hot only one way that people uses media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons
or using the media as there are media users (Blumler & Katz, 1974).

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's bac kpround, such a5 experience, interests, and
education, affect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best Saapthaie
needs. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications
ial using different media. MeQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-person
interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape fram routine or
problems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (2) Personal

identity: self reference; reality exploration: value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance (forms of informa-
tion seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by MoGulre (1974), based
on a general theory of human needs, He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” Initiation, “external” versus
“internal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. 4
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch and Haas
(1973) developed 35 needs taken fram the sacial and psychological functions of the mass media and
put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding;

3. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;

3. Personal integrative needs, including crealbility, stability, status;

4. Social integrotive needs, incluaing interacting with family and friends; and

5. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion

Congruously, NicQuail’s (1983) classification af the following common reasons for media use:

world
