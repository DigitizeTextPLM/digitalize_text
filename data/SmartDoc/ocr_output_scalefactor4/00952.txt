Hardld Lasswell (1902-L900) was a prominent scholar in the

and discovering the effect of propaganda om the mass audience (Rogers, 14"). Ait er een
the mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 1994). Generally, content analysis aor :
defined as, ".,.the investigation of communication messages by categorizing message content into classific = a
in order to measure certain variables" (Rogers, 1994). In an essay entitled "Contents of Communication,
Lasswell (1946) explains that a content analysis should take into account the frequency vol which Rnalll
symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try ta persuade the audience's nual ahs and
the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell (1940) aims to
achieve the goal of understanding the “stream of influence that runs from control to content and fram content
to audience” (p. 74).

This method of content analysis is tied strongly to Lasswell (1955) early definition of communication which
stated. "Who says what in which channel to whom and with what effects” (p. &4). Content analysis Was @5sen-
tially the says what part of this definition, and Lasswell went on to do a lot of work within this area during the

area of propaganda researc h. He focused on

derstanding the content of propaganda,

remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system. In this
way, Lasswell has created a cycle, whereby the public is limited in the information that is presented to them,
and also apprehensive to accept it. However, it Ls still that information that is affecting their decisions within
the democratic system, and is being presented to them by the government This is an interesting way of viewing
the power of the media that is somewhat similar to Lippmann’s theories ce

12 Edward Bernays (1891-1995)

At approximately the same time that Lippmann and Lasswell were examining public opinion and propaganda,
Edward Bernays (1891-1995) was examining public relations, propaganda, and public opinion. Bemays (1928)
defines propaganda 25, a consistent, enduring effort to create or shape events to influence the relations of a
public to an enterprise, idea, or group (p. 25). Contrary to other propaganda theorists, Bemays recognizes
that propaganda can be either beneficial or harmful to the public. [t can help individuals decide ahar tn think
about or alter the opinions of individuals, but this may actually be beneficial to society's functloning as a whole
Bermays states, “We are govenved, qur minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas sugsested largely =
men we have never heard of... Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they : a th :
together as a smoothly functioning society (p. 9). See
Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be modified, and that such shaping is a necessary part

society, Bemays pursued his work in the field of public relations. "Public a esisis onl + i Fa cae _
