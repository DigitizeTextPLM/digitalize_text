1) Other Propaganda Theorists
1.1) Harold Lasswell (1902-1978)

As Lippmann ws writing propaganda, Harold Lasrwell was undertaking empirical analyses of propaganda. Im
fact, much of che propaganda that Lasswell was examining was actoally being written by Lippmaan himeelf
(Rogers, 1544).

Harold Laswwell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in ihe area of propaganda research. He focused om
éonducting both quantitative and qealitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the conent of propaganda,
andl dscenering the effect of propaganda on the mast aodience (Rogers, (14. Lanswell is credited wiih cresting
ihe mass communication procedure of content analysis (Rogers, 194) Generally, comer analysis can be
defined as, *...the investigation of communication messages by casegorizing message content imo classificadons
in coder to measure certain variahles" (Rogers, 1414). be an essay cmcled “Contents of Communication,”
Lashwell (1946) explains that « cone acalrsis should take into account the frequency with which certain
symbols. appear ie a message, the direction in which the symbols try bo persuade the auchence’s opinion, and
the intensity od the symbols used. By undersanding the concent of the merswage, Lasewell (145) aims in
achieve the geal of understanding the “stream od influence that runs from contend oo cement and from coment
to audience” ip. 74).

Tihs method af oombent analysis is teed strongly te Lasswell (1953) early defirmion of communication which

tially the says what part of this definition, and Lavrwell worst on to de a lowol work within this area during che
remainder of his career.

Aside from understanding the content of propageeda, Lessenell wus also invencsted in how propaganda could
shape public opinion. This deal primarily with undersanding the effects of the midia. Lasswelll was particularly
interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democrat: sysiem. In this
way, Laswell has creeped a . whereby the public is limmed in the information that i peesented io them,

12 Edward Bernays (1091-1995)

Ad approximalely Ube same ime that Lippmann and Lawawell were examining public opinion and peopagancls,
Edward Bemays (1291-1596) was examining public relatesns ganda, and pablic opinion. Bemays
defines propaganda as, a consistent, enduring effort to create oe shape events 1 influence the relations of a
public to an enterprise, idea, or group (p. 25) (Contrary io other peopaganda dheors, Bemays recognines.
that propaganda cae be either beneficial or harmful oo the puélic. 1 can help individeals deckde what 0 think

Based on these ideas that the public opinion can be modified, and that such shaping is 4 necessary part of
