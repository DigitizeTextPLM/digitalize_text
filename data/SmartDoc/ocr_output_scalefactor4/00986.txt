The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creats applications of diffu-
sion theory int such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously
mentioned, communication, Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was
suffering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005.

: According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu-
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
15 an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu-
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful, Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, $-M-C-R-E
(e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect), Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this $-M-C-R-E commu-
fication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19), Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a mew idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal of mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(4) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variable
is a ¥ery important factor, According to Rogers (1993), time variable is involved in diffusion in (1)
the innowation-decision process, (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovation’s rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped nvte of adoption, Difficion research hes attempted to explain the variables
that influence how and why users and audience adopt a new information mediwn, such as the Internet.
deconding to evolution of media technology, interpersonal influences are important even though in the
past the individual ix wswally the unit of analysts, Also, critical mass becomes an impo rant factor tr
adopting new media hecawse new media are interactive tools and thus are required by many users to
gain efficiency, Thar iy, the more people wse, the mare people get benefits. In this sense, diffusion
theory not only can apply te practical things, but also carn be related to digital divide,

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innavativeness:
“(1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 183-185), Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his sacial system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure 1 shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adaption curve. Also, these categories
follow a standard deviation curve which is bell-shaped. Source by www2-gew-edulwwwitr/docs/dif-
fusion’ Figure 2 shows that an innovation would spread through society over various periods of time in
a S-shaped curve. However, a5 noted above, different types of innovations (2-2. the: rate of tetracycline
adoption is faster than that of the hybrid seed com) can have their own different rates in diffusion. Fig-

there are five slages.
