of conversation and a structure to the daily routine (Berelson, 1949). For these diverse dimensions of usage
satisfaction, psychologist Herzog (1944) marked them with the term “eratifications.”

Uses and gratifications approach became prevailing in the late 1950s till 1970s when television has grown
up. Some basic assumptions of the approach were proposed when it was rediscovered during that era. Among
the proup of scholars who focus on uses and gratifications research, Elihu Katz is one of the most well-known
and contributed greatly to establishing the structure of the approach

Elihu Katz is served both as a sociologist and as a communication researcher. He received his PhD, in So-
ciology in 1956 from Columbia University and began teaching at the University of Chicago until 1964. During
the next thirty years, he taught in the Department of Sociology and Communication at the Hebrew Univer-
sity of Jerusalem, In the late 1960, invited by the Government of Israel, Katz headed the task force charged
with the Introduction of television broadcasting. This experience led te his subsequent academic work about
broadcasting and television in leisure, culture and communication from the 19706 tolgo0s Hie ee 2001). | n
