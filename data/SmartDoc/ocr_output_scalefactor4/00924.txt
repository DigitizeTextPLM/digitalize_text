Like many other sinocturalet scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural linguestics.
To Saussure, the linguistic mechaninm operates on tec levels, tha sysiematic system and the variation
by Senabing actors. The former is called langue ard ie lather parcia. Langue is thee syshernatted set

it as apposed bo i speech (parcie] is cowers the purely individual part of language” (Barthes, 1967,
p14), Barthes nterprats Sauasunes inguaslic system within ine social dimension. The sinciure level,
langue, ib the social ponwention of value shared through # society which is stabiined anc standandined.
On the contrary, parcié is exible because: it # the actual expression af the individieal kerwel, Horever,
