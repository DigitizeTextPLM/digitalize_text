1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses and pratfications approach emphasizes motives and the sell-perceived needs of audience mem-
bers. Blumer and Katz (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication mes-

sage for very diferent purposes. The same media content may gratily diferent needs for different
individuals. There ls not only one way that peoole uses media. Contrarily, there are as many reasons

for using the media as there are media uters [Blumer & Katz, 1974).
Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and
education, afiect people's ideas about what they want from media and which media best meet their

needs, That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratifications
for using different media. McCluail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) propeded a madel of “media-person
inkerachons” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape fram routine ar

problems; emational release: (2) Personal relationships: companionship: social utility: (4) Personal

Hentity: self reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance [forms of imforma-

ahective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “pasha”

initiation, “external” versus
Cntemal” goal orientation, and amotion stability of “gresth™ and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 GAerent bees of motivations which ap
