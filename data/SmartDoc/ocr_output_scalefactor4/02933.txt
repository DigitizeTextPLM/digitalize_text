teaching at the Institute, Adare lost his right to teach in September 1933 due to the rise to power of the Nazi
party, f Horkheimer had already sel up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerlared, ard the Institute began
operat ing hare. The Nazis rise to power not only meant that Adore Jost his job and would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jorgen Habermas would later nate, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe-
mences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48).

Adorno was at Ooclord from 1994 to 198, where he worked on a manuscript on Husserl, He was considered
an cutsider, never integrating into the British academic mainstream, and be looked forward to joining his Frank-
furt School colleagues, many of whom hed in the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the late
19302 Adome evidenced lithe: hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during ihe
19305, Benjamin and Adoma debated mass culture, since film and radio became the tvo0 moat popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated #3 “(hn the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Artin the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adomo lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed ina concert hall, symphonic works could
mow be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records, The result was inferior to the
original, and Adorno was emphatic iin his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape crane the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Aderno, BO1b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or filen
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adama, the aura ofthe original artwork wats Lh
aggential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reprodiction pia aera oe the
