1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p, 95). This business was based on what Adorno referred to as Fordist
capitalism, in which mass production based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were implemented in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl,
1995, p. 142). Examples of thisnot specified by Adornowere the Hollywood production system, or
the CBS radio network that had been associated with the Princeton Radio Research Project. Movies
and hit songs were based on formulas, and the formula supplants the work (Horkheimer and Adorno
2002, p. $9). Mechanical reproduction ensured that there would not be any real change to the ee
and that nothing truly adversarial to the system would emerge (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p
106-7). Paradoxically, any innovation would only reafiirm the system, and Adorno cited ees Welles
as an example of someone who was allowed to break the rules. The elasticity in the system would
allow it to assume the stance of any opposition and make it its own, ultimately rendering it ineffectual
(Friedman, 1981, p. 165). Like religion and other institutions, the culture industry was an instrument
of social control (Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002, p. 120), but freedom to choose in a system of aaa
coercion ultimately meant the freedom to be the same (Horkheimer and Adorno C02 136
