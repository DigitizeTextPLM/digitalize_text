Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural linguistics
To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates on two levels, the systematic system and the Gareian
by speaking actors. The former is called langue and the latter parole. Langue is the systamatized set
of conventions necessary to communication, indifferent to the material of the signal which compose
it; as opposed to it, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language" (Barthes, 1967,
p.13). Barthes interprets Saussures linguistic system within the social dimension. The structure level,
lanque, is the social convention or value shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized.
On the contrary, parole is flexible because it is the actual expression at the individual level. However,
it is considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the
shared convention, the structure.

A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. lt is the social part of
language, it is essentially a collective contract which one must accept in its entirety if ane
wishes to communicate. It is because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social insti-
tution, In contrast to language, which ts both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization. The speaking subject can use the code
af the language with a view to expressing his personal thought It is because speech is
essentially a combinative activity that it corresponds to and individual act and not to a pure
creation. (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-15)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguishes the language system into two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which ig expressed through the form.
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, bath the word
dog in English or in Korean are the external forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the actual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "| propose to retain the word sign (signe) to
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified {signifié) and

signifier (significant); the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa
rates them from each other and from the whole of which they are parts” (Saussure, 1959, in R. Innis
fed_), p. 37). The correspondence of the conceptimeaning to ihe external form is not in the destined
relation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable internal relation but the differance
between the signs that operates tne signifying system. Saussure (1960) argues that “language does
not reflect a pre-existent and external reality of independent objects, but constructs meaning from
within itself through a series of canceptual and phonic differences". According to Saussure, "meaning
is produced through a process of selection and combination of signs along two axes, the syntagmatic
(e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (6.9., synonyms), organized into a signifying system” (Barker,
2002, p. 29). Asa grammatical set of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic comprises a sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another. Despite various possibilities in selecting the signs within the
game paradigmatic, the selection is also regulated by the consensus of linguistic paar
members. For an example of the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the pei
ing sentence: “I went to a theater with my girlfriend.” This sentence 's established throug “E
linear combination of signs. The signs within the example, such as | theater, Ty and aie oan be
substituted for by other signs in the paradigmatic, such a& ‘She went to a restaurant with her pens
