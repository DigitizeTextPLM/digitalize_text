Uses and Gratifications

1.1. Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach ts an influential tradition in media research, The original
conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of
eenain media contents. The core question of such research @. Why do prople use media
and what do they wee them for? (MoQuail, 1283). There exists a basic idea in this appreaecn:
audience members know media content, and which media they can use to meet their needs.
In the mass communication process, uses and gratifcations aporaach puts fe funchan of
linking need gralifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience members. It
Suggests that people's needs influence whal media they would choose, how they ue car-
fain media and what grafficalions the media give them. This approach ditters from other
theoretical perspectives in that it regards audiences a6 active media users as opposed bo
pascive receivers of information. In contrast to badiional madia effects theories which foous
on “what media do to peogle” and assume audiences are homogenaous, uses and gratifica-
tions approach is more conceme|d with “what people do with media” (Katz, 1255). [t allows
audiences personal needs to use media and responds to ihe media, which determined by
their gocial and psychological background. Uses and gralifications approach also postulates,
that the media compete with other information 2ources for audience's need satisfaction (Fatt
eial, 1974a). As braditional mass media and mew media continue to provide people wilh &
wide range of media platfonns and content, if is considered one of the most appropriate
perspectives for investigating why audiences choose to be exposed bo differant.

The approach emphasizes audiences’ choice by assessing their reasons for using
acertain media to the disregard of offers, as well as the various grafifications obtained
from fhe media, based on individual social and psychological requirements (Severin
4 Tarkerd, 1997). Asa broader perspective among communication researches, it pro-
vides @ framework for understanding the processes by which media participants seek
information or content selectively, commensurate with their needs and interests (Katz
etal, 1974a), Audience members then incorporate the content fo fulfill their needs or
fo satiety their interests (Lowery & Mabila, 1983).

chology and sociology over the past 100 years. With illumed by valuable ideas as well ae
