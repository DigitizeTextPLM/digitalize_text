* formation of pubbe opinion. Tn eppesition ta Lippmann, whe viewa the public aa being, easily
manipulated, Betnays cautions agalnat this He claims, The public is not an amorphous mass which
tan be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea
that in attempting te influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be
made atnicable and mutually beneficial, | must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the
Public in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept (p. 66).

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
Matipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays precenta public relations az a tool that can be
us√©l to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader, The objective-minded public relations
inan helps his client adjust to the contemparary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays,
1952, p, 9). Bernags view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognises the power of
society, but still also claims that manipulation of the public is possible, Bernays (1052) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations ip important. because it helps them
to understand the society of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modiving conditions that affects ws, to evaluate efforts being made by others,
amd to persuade of Sugeest courses of action [p. 10). Uneber this framework, while manipulation of
the problle le still possible, it is net in each blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as
Lippmann and Ellul teoded te disagree with this point.

1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily ta both the direct effects and limited effects
media models, Theorists such as Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct effects model, whereby
propaganda could directly influence the thought of the masses. Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippmann
alee noted that the media might net be influencing caly thought, but may also be influencing what
people thought about. It was this line of thinking that resultec| in a starting point for future research
on the area of the limited effects of the media. Such limited effects were shown through the wark of
Iyengar and Kinder, aa well as McCombs and Shaw. Overall, the: research of the scholars discussed in
this paper has been very important to the understanding of the media, the manipulation of the public,
anid the formation of public opinion. While the theories of Lippmann, Lasswell, Bernays, and Ellul
were formed years ago, they continue te help us understand the society that surrounds us today.
