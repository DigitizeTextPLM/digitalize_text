i. GENES OF “THE CULTURE IVDUSTRE”

Genesis of “The Culture Industry”

In order to understand the creation of the idea of the culture industry as well as its reception te concept can be
examined chronologically, from its pre-conditions, through its generation, to 113 5 subsequent impact. The idea ot

he culture industry erows out of a concem with culture, is developed through 1 insights into the mechanical re-
eae culture, and is ultimately generated in opposition not only to popular music, but also to Hollywood
movies. That this is so grows out of a number of historical contingencies.

Adome was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends, Since Benjamin
never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adorno
became in effect Benjamins only pupil, After Benjamin's death “itwas Adora whe then intreduced a ratioral-
ized version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (Jager, 2004, p. 65-6}. The relationship with Benjamin had
an impact on the development of Adernos thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adomoe began
teaching at the Institute. Adorno lost his right to teach in September 1933 due te the rise to power of the Nazi
party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began
operating there. The Nazis rise to power not only meant that Adomo Lost his job and would event ually force his
departure from Germany, but alse affected his philosophical thought. As Jfirgen Habermas would later note, the
fact that labor movements were co-opted in the development of fy cist regimes was one of the historical expe
riences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production
of mass culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48).

1930s, Benjamin and Adorno debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” is in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's mare
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adomo lay in the fact that instead of being enjoy ed inaconcert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard aver the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adorno was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape from the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adomo, 2001b, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes tied to class, to Adorno, the aura of the original artwork was the
essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge against the
authority of Platonic order from the top-the original or Idea- to down of layers of imitations; to Adormo, mass
production was nothing but the destruction of the authenticity. The general attitude of the Frankfurt school
was that of Adore. In 1938 Max Horkheimer, who had succeeding in establishing a relationship for the
Institute of Social Research with Columbia University that enabled the Institute to continue working in
New York, obtained a position for Adorn at the Princeton Radio Research Project, ron by Paul Lazars-
feld, Adorno, anxious to leave Britain in the hopes of being with other members of the Institute, accepted
the position, although he later claimed that he did not know what a “radio project” was. For his part,
Lazarsfeld looked forward to working with Adorno, whom he knew to be an expert on music. Adorno
wrote for the Project's journal in 1941, reiterating his position that radio was only an image of a live perfor-
mance. In addition, he questioned the claim by the radio industry that the medium was bringing serious music
to the masses (Wiggershaus, 1994, p, 243). While working at the Princeton Radio Research Project Adorno
hecame shocked at the degree to which culture had become commercialized in the United States.

Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the two theorists became friends. Since Benjamin
never received a degree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, Adora
hecame in effect Benjamins only pupil. After Benjamin's death “it was Adorno who then introduced a rational
ized version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (Jager, 2004, p. 65-6). The relationship with Benjamin had
an impact on the development of Adornos thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adorno began

party. Horkheimer had already set up a branch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute began
