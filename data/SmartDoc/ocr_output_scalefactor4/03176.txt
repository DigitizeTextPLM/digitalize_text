Uses and Gratifications

1.1. Introduction

Wises and gratifications approach is an influential tradition in media rasearch. The ofigiial
conception of the approach was baged on the research for explaining the great appeal of
pertain media contents. The core question of such research is: Vwhy do peaple use media
and what do they use them for? (MoQual, 1963), There exists a basic idea in this approach:
audience members know media content, and which media they can use to meet their needs.
in the mass communication process, uses and gratdicalions approach puts the function of
linking need gratfications and media choise clearly on the side of auckence members. It |

suggests thal people's needs influence what media they would choose, how fey wee cer
tain media ane what gratifications the media give them, Thes approach differs fram other
theoretical perspectives in ihal it regards audiences as active media users af Opposed ta
passive receivers of information, in contrast to traditional media effects thrones which focus
on “whal media de to people” and assume audiences ane hamogenéous, uses and grabilica-
tions approach is more concemed with “what people do with media” (Kabr 1989). Hallows

iheir social and psychological background. Uses and gratificatons approach alao posiulaies J

from the media, based of individual social and psychological requirements (Severin |
& Tankard, 1997). 4s 4 broader perspective among communication researches, it pro-
vides @ franrework for understanding the processes by which media participants seek
information or content selectively. commensurate with their needs and interests (Katz
etal, 1974). Audience mombers then incorporate the content to fulfill their needs or
