According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process bey

That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication :

(e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this §-M-C-R-b commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender

interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or soctal change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variable
is a Very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), ime variable is involved in diffusion in (1)

According to evolution of media technology, interpersonat influences are important even thougn in the
past the individual is usually the wnit of analysis. Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in

adopting new media hecause new media are inferactive tools and thus are required by many users to
gain efficiency, That is, the more people use, the more people get henefits. Jn this sense, diffusion
theory not only can apply to practical things, but alse cart be related to digital divide.

There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
1) Innovators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (3) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Laggards (traditional)” (Rogers, 1993, pp. 183-185), Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting new ideas than other
members of his social system” (Rogers, 1995, p. 40). Figure | shows the relationships between types
of adopters divided by innovativeness and their place on the adoption curve. Also, these cate ae
