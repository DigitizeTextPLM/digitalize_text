Lh found social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a sub-
stantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation initiall '
worked at the University of Rochester, but in 145 he followed Lewin to iiaeasieieits tast
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin death, Festinger
wratkec! at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
(Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin's theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging field of in-
terpersonal communication and on the development of LRT. Festinger is best known for the theories
of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theary (CDT) attempted to
explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed COT
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). CDT allows for three
relationships to occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equi-
lihrium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each
other: and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another
(West & Tumer, 2000). Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of arousal and dis~
comfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison theary postulates that individuals look te
feedback from others to evaluate their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self, the individual
usually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to the self. This need for soctal comparison can
eesult in conformity pressures (Trenholm 4 Jensen, 2004), Berger and Calabrese (1975) related so-
cial comparison to URT by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons seek out similar others
who are proximate when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of
their behavior and/or opinions in a particular situation” (p. 107}. Festinger received the Distinguished
Scientist award of the ‘American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Senior Scientist
