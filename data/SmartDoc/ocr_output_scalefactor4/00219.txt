1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of he
culture industry outside of a Geran content. In the years aince there have beer numer:
cas criticiems of the text, not Imast since Adora made sweeping generalizations about “the

ified and fetishized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1996, p. 413), For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adomo erred in nol discussing the processes of cub
tural production, and tailed bo examine the culture industry's aconomic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1956, p. 4B)

For Terry Eagleton, bath Adamo and Marcuse ewerashmabed the dominant ideology, be-
feving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip ofan all-pervesive reiheation” (Eagiesan,
4581. p. 46). Stil, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
among oppressed pecoles in society has some part te play in the reproduciion of the aye
tem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1957, p. 38). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adora idea
ef a culture industry was historically lrniled, since the society that developed in the 19605
and 19706 ath new media wel beyond the cultural posaibilities avedable during the 1340s.

Thus for aome cfitics modernist works would be counteracting forces against ihe dominant
