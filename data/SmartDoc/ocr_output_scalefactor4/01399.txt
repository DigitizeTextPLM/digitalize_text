1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has been identified as an important construct, necessary to the study of commu:
fication, it would be beneficial to know when the comcept originated, and bow it has been defined
and studied. One way to consider uncertainty is through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when there
was a high amount of possible alternatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the transmission of messages, but their work
also contributed to the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopted concepts from the
information theorists as well a3 Helder (1958) research in attribution, Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty to fit interpers onal communication by defining uncertainty as
the “number of alternative ways in which each interactant might behave" (p. 100 }. The greater the
level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to pre-
diet behaviors and occurences. During interactions individuals are not only faced with prablems af
predicting present and past behaviors, but also explaining why partners behave or Laer
that they do. Berger and Bradac’s (1982) detinition of uncertainty highlighted the complexity @
