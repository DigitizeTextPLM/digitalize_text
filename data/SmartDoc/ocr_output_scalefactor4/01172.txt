1 Needs and Gratifications
Uses ane gratiications agiproach emphasizes motives and the self:perceived needs of audience mem-
bers. Blumlerand Katz (1974) concluded that diferent people can use the same cOMimurticathon reps
cage for very different purposes The same media content may gratify different needs for diferertt
ineividuals. There is pot only one-way that people uses media. Contrarily, there are as many rearons
for using the mecha as there are media users [Blumier & Kate, 1974).

Batic needs, sociel sttuation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, and
education, affect people's ideas about what they wart from media ard which media best meet their
needs, That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratificatsans
for using different media. McChuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-persan
interactions” ie classify four important media gratificatians: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or
problems; emotional release; (2] Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; [3] Personal
identity: calf reference; reality exploration; value reinforces; and (4) Surveillance [forms of informa-
tion seeking).

Arother subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by MoGuire (1974), based
on a general theory of human needs. He distinguished betawen tea types of needs: oogretive and
aAecte. Then he added three dimensions: “active” verge “passive” initiation, “external” versus
“internal” goal orentation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types.of motivations which apaly to media use [Figure 1). Fagure 1. A
