Adorno was introduced to Walter Benjamin in 1923, and the twe theorists became friends. Since Benjamin
never received adegree that would allow him to teach at a university, according to Hannah Arendt, a
became in effect Benjamins only pupil. After Benjamin's death “in was Adore who then introduced a rationa m
ined version of his ideas into academic philosophy.” (Jager, 2004, p. 63-6). The relationship with Benjamin had
an impact on the development of Adomos thought during this period. Returning to Frankfurt, Adare began
teaching at the Institute. Adomo lost his right te teach in September 1933 duc to the rise to power af the Nazi
party. Horkheimer had already set up a beanch of the Institute in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Institute bewart
operating there. The Nazis rise to pawer not only meant that Adomo lost his job and would eventually force his
departure from Germany, but also affected his philosophical thought. As Jirgen Habermas would liter note, the:
fact that labor movements were co-opted in ihe development of fascist regimes was one of the historical expe-
riences influencing the development of critical theory, the others being Stalinist repression and the production
af mass culture in the United States (Moris, 2001, p. 48)

Adon was at Oxford fram 1934 te 1998, where he worked on a manuscript on Husserl. He was considered
an outsider, newer integrating into the British academic mainstream, and he looked forward to joining, his Frank=
furt School colleagues, many of whom kad in the meantime moved to the United States. Already in the lare
1930s Adore evidenced little hope for mass culture, As propagonda and entertainment increased during the

19306, Beniamin and Adora debated mass culture, since film and radia became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships, The essay translated as “Qin the Fetish

oplimisie eisay, “The Work of Art inthe Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorst, 9%, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adamo lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a coneert hall, symphonic works could
now be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records, The result was inferior to the
original, and Adora was emphatic in his condemnation of the mechanical reproduction of music: “Together
