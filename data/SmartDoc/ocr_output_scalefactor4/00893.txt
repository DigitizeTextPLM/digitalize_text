>. In the mass communication process much initiative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation a
theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes
behavior.

2, The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
mass communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs,
and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consump-
tion certainly varies.

4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- Le., people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in
particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

5. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms. (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous researches on
gtatifications detected diverse pratifications that attract people on the media, they did mot address the
connections between these pratifications (Kate et al., 1974a), They suggested that uses and gratifi-
cations research concern with following aspects: “(1) the social and the psychological origins of (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) dif-
ferential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in (6) need gratification and (7) other
consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones” (Katz et al., 1974b, p. 20). The studies of Katz and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the uses and gratifications approach, Since
then, the research on this subject has been strengthened and extended. The current status of uses and
pratifications is sull based on Katz’s first analysis, particularly as new media forms have emerged in
such an electronic information age when people have more options of media use,

1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses and gratifications approach emphasizes matives and the self-percei i
bers. Blumler and Katz (1974) concluded that different people be a sana sae pecs tame
sage for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for differen
individuals, ‘There is not only one way that peaple uses media, Contrarily, there are as ete
