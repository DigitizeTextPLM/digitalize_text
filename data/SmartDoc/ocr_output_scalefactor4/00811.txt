CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Understanding of the public, and the nevessity of attention-generating propaganda in influenci

public opinion (Bernays, 1955, p22]. Bernays (1955) himself made a statement regarding his phrase,
the engineering of consent. He said, Engineering implies planning. And it is careful planning more
than anything else that distinewishes modern public relatiome from old-time hit or miss publicity and
propaganda (Bernays, 1955, p.22) Furthermore, Bernays theories also represent & different view of
the formation of public opinion. In apposition to Lippmann, who views the public as being easily
manipulated, Bernavs cautions agaimet this, He claims, The public is not an amorphous Mass which
can be molded at will or dictated to (Bernays, 1928, p. 66). Instead, Bernays (1928) offers the idea
that in attempting to influence the public, a business must study what terms the partnership can be
made amicable and mutually beneficial, It must explain itself, its aims, its objectives, to the
publie in terms which the public can understand and is willing to accept [p 66)

Bernays elaborates on these ideas in Public Relations (1952). Rather than merely attempting to
manipulate the public through propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that can he
used to combine the ideas of the public and the persuader.

The objective-minded public relations
an helps his client adjust to the contemporary situation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays

1952, p. 0). Bernays view of the public is softer than that of Lippmann, as he recognises the power of
society, but still also claims thal manipulation of the public is possible. Bernays (1952) writes of the
benefits of public relations, To citizens in general, public relations is important because it helpa them
to understand the eociety of which we are all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
to exert leadership in modifying conditions that affects us, to evaluate efforts being made by others
and to persuade or suggest courses of action [p. 10), Under this framework, while manipulation of
the public is still possible, it is not in such blatant ignorance of the public opinion. Theorists such as

Lippmann and Ellul tended to disagree with this point.
