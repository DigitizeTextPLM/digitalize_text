warned, rigid institutionalization transforms modern mass culture into a medium of undreamed

of psychological control (Adorno, 201a, p. 160). It was one of the few oceasions in the 1950s
that, Adorno would discuss the implications of mass culture. At least one observer found it
strange that the leading cultural theorist of his day did not take part in cultural developments
of the fifties (Jager, 2004, p. 191). Adorno would nonetheless on occasion atternpt to reshape
his thought on the culture industry. For example, in 1959 he wrote of a universal pseudo-culture
in the United States (Adorno, 1993, p. 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany in 1963 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the essay Transparencies on Film,
Adorno conceded that film-making might be an acceptable cultural practice in opposition to
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hohendahl, 1995, p. 131).
