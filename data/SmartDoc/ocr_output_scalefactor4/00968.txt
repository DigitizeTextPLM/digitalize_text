A language is therefore, -a social institution and a system of values. It is the social part of
langu age, itis essentially a collective contract which one must accent in its entirety if one
wishes to communicate. itis because a language is a system of contractual values that it
resists the modifications coming from a single individual and is consequently a social insti-
tution. In contrast to language, which is both institution and system, speech is essentially
an individual act of selection and actualization, The speaking subject can use the code
of the language with a view to expressing his personal thought. It is because speech is

essentially a combinative activity that It corresponds to and individual act and not to a pure
creation, (Barthes, 1967, pp. 14-75)

Focusing on the systematic level, Sausurre distinguisnes the language system inte two parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a concept or meaning which Is €xpressec through the form
The form is called the signifier, which is the external part of language. For example, beth the word
dog in English or in Korean are the extemal forms expressing the actual animal dog Here, the aciual
animal, the concept in question, becomes the signified. "| propose to retain the word sign (signe) ta
designate the whole and to replace concept and sound-image respectively by signified fsignifié) and
signifier (significant), the last two terms have the advantage of indicating the opposition that sepa-
rates them from each other and fram the whole of which they are parts" (Saussure, 1959 in Ft. nh a
(ed), p. 37). The correspo ndence of the concept'meaning to the extemal form is nat in the des ne
ralation, but rather, in the arbitrary relation. It is not the inevitable internat bean! A the alas
