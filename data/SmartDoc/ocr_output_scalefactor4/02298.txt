1 Early Influences

The following theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty tn communication.
The influence of their work can be scen reflected in the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology at the University of lowa under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,
one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a sub-
stantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication. After graduation, initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts [nsti-
tute of Technology and the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School for Social Research
(Samelson, 2000). Much of Festinger's research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin’s theories. Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging field of in-
terpersonal communication and on the development of UT. Festinger is best known for the theories
of Cognitive Dissonance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) attempted to
explain how an imbalance among cognitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed CDT
in his observations regarding attitude change in small groups (Festinger, 1982). CDT allows for three
relationships to occur aneong cognitions: # consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equi-
librium with each other, a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competition with each
other; and an irrelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect on one another
(West & Tumer, 2000). Cognitive Dissonance, like uncertainty, has an element of arousal and dis-
comfort that individuals seek te reduce, Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to
feedback ftom others to evaluate their performance and abilities, To evaluate the self, the individual
usually secks the opinions of others who are similar to the self. This need for social COMparison can
result in conformity pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, 2004), Berger and Calabrese (1975) related so-
cial comparison to URT by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons seck owt similar others
who abe proximate when they experience a high level of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of
their behavior and/ot opinions ina particular situation” (p. 107). Festinger received the Distinguished
Scientist award of the American Psychological Association and the Distinguished Seni ayer
Award fram the Society of : ' i ‘Senor Scientist
: m te Society of Experimental Social Psychology, Festinger’s legacy is significant, and
his theoretical influence can still be recognized in contemporary social science research. Aron hes
Festinger, 1980) stared, “It was in this era that Leon Festinger inverted and are ee ie
cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, social psychology has not been the sare since” (p. id
