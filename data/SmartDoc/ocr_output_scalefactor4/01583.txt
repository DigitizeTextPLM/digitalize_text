1, NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic assumptions were stated in a study of Katz, Blumler, and Gureviteh in 1974 as follows.

They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media and audiences:

1. ‘The audience is conceived as active, i.c., an important part of of mass media use is
assumed to be goal oriented ... patterns of media use are shaped by more or less
definite expectations of what certain kinds of content have to offer the audience
member.

2. In the mass communication process much initiative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitatan on
theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and
behavior.

3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
mass communication constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs,
and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consump-
tion certainly varies.

4. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- i.c., people
are sufticiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in
partiqular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

$. Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be

suspended while audience orientations are explored on thelr own terms. (p. 15-17). ——————
In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also commented that, although previous researches on ee ;
gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract people on the media, they did not address the
Connections hetween these gratifications (Katz et al, 1974a). They suggested that uses and gratifi-
cations research concern with following aspects: “(1) the social and the psychological origins of (2)
needs which generate (3) expectations of (4) the mags media or other sources which lead to (5) dif-
ferential exposure (or engaging in other activities), resulting in (6) need Bratification and (7) other
consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones” (Katz et al., 1974b, p, 20). The studies of Kate and
his colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the uses and gratifications approach, Since
then, the research en this subject has heen strengthened and extended, The current status of iise5 and
gratifications is still based on Katz's first analysis, particularly as mew media forms have emerged in
such an electronic information age when people have mare options of media use, :
