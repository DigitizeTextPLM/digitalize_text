needs. That is, audience members aré aware of and can state their own matives and gratifications
for using different media. McQuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) proposed a model of “media-persan
interactions” to classify four important media gratifications: (1) Diversion: escape from routine or
roblems; emotional release; (2) Personal relationships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal
identity: self reference; reality exploration; yalue reinforces; and (4) Surveillance (forms of infonma-
tion seeking).

Another subdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (19 74), based
on a general theory of human needs, He distinguished between two types of needs: cognitive and
affective, Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus
“internal” goal orientation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A
structuring of 16 general paradigms of human motivation (McGuire, 1974). Katz, Gurevitch and Haas
(1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and psychological functions of the mass media and
put them into five categories:

1. Cognitive needs, including acquiring information, knowledge and understanding;
i. Affective needs, including emotion, pleasure, feelings;
4. Personal integrative needs, including credibility, stability, status;

. Social integrative needs, including interacting with family and friends; and

. Tension release needs, including escape and diversion.

Congruously, McCuail’s (1983) classification of the following common reasons for media use-
