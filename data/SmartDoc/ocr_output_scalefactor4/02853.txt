1 Conclusion: The Importance of These Theories

The theories developed by Lippmann, Losewell, Ellul, and Bernays are important for a noméer of

The theories presented in this paper have tied heavily to both the direct effects and limited eects
media models. Theorists such ag Ellul tended to side heavily with the direct affects motel, whereby
propaganda could directly influence the thought af the masses. Meanwhile, theorists such as Lippenann
also noted that the media might oot be influencing only thought, but may also be influencing what
people thought abaut. Te was this line of thinking that resulted in a starting point for future research
in the ares of the limitedL effects nf the media. Such limited effects were shown through the work af
lvengar and Binder, a8 well as BMeCombs and Shaw. Crverall, the research of he echalats discussed in
this paper ras been very important to the understanding of the media, the manipulation af the public,
and the formation of public opanian. While
