He comolained to the dean about the radical students in hie classes who were making
teaching impossible, In the winter barm of 1856-69 students occupied a number of buildings
at the University af Frandefurt, including the Insitute for Social Research. After the strike
ended, Adome returned to teaching, bul his lectures conlinued to be disrupted, including
one “tasteless demonatration™ in which three females bared their breasts. Adorno died a tw

4 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1872 Engligh-language translation marked the first real appearance of the dea of the
culture industry outside of a German context. In the years since there have been numer-
cus criliciame of the text not least since Adora made sweeping ganeralizabons about the
commadified and fetishized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1986, p 112). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adome erred in not discussing fhe processes of cul-
jural production, and failed ta examine the culture industry's aconomic- dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Coos, 1966, p. 48).

Far Terry Eagleton, both Adora and Marcuse cvernstimated the dominant ideology, be-
lieving that “capitalist society languishas in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton,
1901, p. 48). Sw, Eagleton conceded that “tne diffusion of dominant values and beliets
among capressed peaples in society has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys
tam as 4 whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 26). Fredic Jameson pointed out that Adome's ide’
af a culture industry wae historically lniled, since the society thal developed in the 19608
and 1870s with new media wenl beyord the cultural possibilities available during the 140s,
While the idea of the culture mdusiry can be defended as a useful theory for induabrial soci-
slies between 1920 and 1970, trying to ute if today weakens its éMfechveness (Hohendahi,
7994, p. 146-48). Thus, for a some critics, tne value of the idea of the culture industry would
appear io be merely histarcal, if they in fact compeded that ithad any value at all.

Thus for some ortics modemist works would be counteracting forces agains! the dominant
ideology. As noted in the example of Cron Welles, however, may be the case that the
dominant ideclogy can co-opt modernist works for its own ends. The idea of the culture
industry has had an importance in critical theory since fis appearance in the 19405, in that
it has led to thought about the role of mass communications in relation te ideology, and
hence, society. Since Adana made dweaping generalizations about the impact of the culture
industry, and since he did not systematically explore how the cukure industry operated, it has
been generally easy for some bo demise the dea of a culbune industry, | is nonetheless he
