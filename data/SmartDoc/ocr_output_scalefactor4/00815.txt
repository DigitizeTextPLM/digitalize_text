Of Mass Culture in the United States (Morris, 2001, p. 48).

Already in the late
1930s Adorno evidenced lithe hope for mass culture. As propaganda and entertainment increased during the
1930s, Benjamin and Adome debated mass culture, since film and radio became the two most popular means
to disseminate propaganda under the fascist and Stalinist dictatorships. The essay translated as “On the Fetish
Character in Music and the Regression in Listening” 1s in effect a pessimistic reply to Walter Benjamin's more
optimistic essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (Brunkhorsi, 1999, p. 62). A pri-
mary problem for Adomo lay in the fact that instead of being enjoyed in a concert hall, symphonic works could
ow be heard over the radio, and could be reproduced on phonograph records. The result was inferior to the
original, and Adorno was emphatic in his condemnation of the mec hanical reproduction of music: “Together
with sport and film, mass music and the new listening help to make escape trom the whole infantile milieu
impossible” (Adorno, 20016, p. 47). While Benjamin regarded the destruction of aura by photograph or film
as the emancipation from hierarchical tastes ted to class, to Adorno, the aura of the om ginal artwork wils pte
essential of the artistic authenticity. To Benjamin, the mechanical reproduction was the challenge teal the
