i DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research condacted under the title of iexerpersonal communcacion initially focused on persaasion,
social influence, and small group processes, Theories explored the role of learning, dissomance, hal-
ance, social judgment, and reactance (Herper, 2005). Kert Lewin, a forefather of social peychology,
Played a oomiderable role in influencing interpersonal research piomeers such as Festinger, Heider,
Kelley, and Hovland, By the 1970s, research interests began te shift intothe realm of social interaction,
relational development, and relational control, This was influenced by the research of such scholars
ia Knapp, Mebrabian, Almun, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibaut Doring the laver part of che decade
and into the 198s, the cognitive approaches af Hewes, Planalp, Raloff, and Berger became popular

Berger (2005) states: “these early cheoretical forays helped shape the imerpersonal comm research
agemda during the past pwn decades” (p. 216). Today, interpersonal comimunicanon pends to docs
on dyadic communication, communication involving face-to-face interaction, or Cooimunicaticm as
a function of developing relarionships. Research into interpersonal cocnmunicaton theory typically
focuses on the development, maintenance, and dissolurian of relationships. It has been neoagnined
that interpersonal communication is motivated by uncertainty reduction (Berger & Calabrese, 1575).
Since its inmrectaction in the 17s, uncemaincy has been necogniaed asa major field of enacty that fas.
Contribated to the development af the field of commranication as a whole, This chapter strives to focus:
on these theorists who pioneered the research of uncemalncy reduction in communication. Their werk
isoneciad to the development of dhe field of interpersonal communication, and is cencral in our
bnderstanding of interpersonal processes.

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since umcerainty has been identified as am impertant comstnact, necessary to the study of comm-
ficalion. @ woukl be beneficial io know when the concept originated, and how it has been defined
and studied, Cine way to consider uncertainey is though the theoretical framework of lnfoenmaricn
theory. Shanmon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty existed in a given situation when theme
was a high amount of possiile altermatives and the probability of their event was relatively equal.
Shannon and Weaver related this view of uncertainty to the Iransmission of messages, but their work.
ales eonmribured tthe development of LRT. Berger and Calabrese (1575) adopted concepts from the
information theorists as well as Heider (1959) research im attribution. Berger and Calabrese (1575)
mqnanded the concept of uncertainty io Gi interpersonal communication by defining uncenainty a
the “number of alemalive ways in which each infteractant might behave” (p. 100). The greater the
level of uncertainty that exists in a situation, the smaller the chance individuals will be able to pre-
Get behaviors and occurences. Goring inperactbons individuals are not only faced with problems af
preclicting present and past behaviors, ui also explaining why partners behave of believe tin the way
thal they do, Berger and Bradac's (1982) definition of uncertainty heghligheed the complexiry of this
process when they staped: “Uncertainty, then, can stem from the large momber of alvermative thangs
that a stranger cam believe or potentially say" Uncertainty plays a sagnificar: mode when examining
relationships. High levels of uncertainty can severely inhibit relational developoene. Lincernadinty ett

2000), Incompetent communicators may not be able to develop relationships or may be noo anxices
io engage in initial interactions. West and Tumer (2000) note that lower levels of uncertainty caused
increased yerbal amd nonverbal behavior, increased levels of intimacy, and increased liking. In iner-
actions individuals are expected to increase predictability with the goal that this will ead to the ability
to predict and explain what will occur in funare imeractions. Wiben high uncertainty exists it is after
difficult to reach this goal. Alihough individuals seek co reduce uncertainty, high levels of certainty
and predictability can also inhibit a relationship, Heath and Bryant (20M) state: “Too much certainty
and predictability cam deaden a relationship;
