1 The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception

For Adorno, popular culture on film and radio did not bother to present itself as art. They were instead
a business, and this in turn became an ideology to legitimize t the trash they intentionally produce
(Horkheimer ane ry Lorne, 2002, p. $4). This business was bas selon what Adorno referred to as Fordist

capitaliam, in which mass pre oduction based on the techniques used by Henry Ford were tnplements cl in
the cultural sphere, insofar as these tendencies were based on centralization and hierarchy (Hohendahl,
1995, p. 142). Examples of thisnot speciiied by Adomowere the Hollywood production syetem, oF
