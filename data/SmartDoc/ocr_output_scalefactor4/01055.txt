Uncertainty Reduction

1.1. Advances in Interpersonal Communication: Cha rles Berger, Richard Cal-
abrese and Key Uncertainty Theorists

Since the mid-twentieth century, the concept of information has been a strong foundation for communication
research and the development of communication theery. Information exchange is a basic human function in
which individuals request, provide, and exchange information with the goal of reducing uncertainty. Uncer-
tainty Reduction theory (URT), accredited to Charles R. Berger and Richard 1 Calabrese (1975), recognized that
reducing uncertainty was a central motive of communication, Through the development of URT, these scholars
pioneered the field of interpersonal communication by examining this significant relationship in uncertainty
research, Heath and Bryant (2000) state: “One of the motivations underpinning interpersonal communication
is the acquisition of jnformation with which to reduce uncertainty” (p. 153). The study of information is basic
to all fields of communication, but its relation to the study of uncertainty in particular advanced theoretical
research in the field of interpersonal communication. URT places the role of communication into the central
focus which was 4 key step in the development of the field of interpersonal communication. Berger and Cal-
abrese (1975) note: “When communication researchers have conducted empirical research on the interpersonal
they have tended to employ social psychological theories as starting points” (p. 9).
theory and efforts made by other contemporaries marked the emergence of inter
personal communication research, with the development of URT, comrnunication researchers began to look te

communication for theories of greater understanding rather than theoretical approaches founded in other social
SCIerices.
