Rogers was born in Carroll, lowa in 1931. He earned his B.A., M_A., and PhD, degrees from lowa
State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S, Air Force. Interestingly,
in 1966, he worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea,

The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it creats applications of diffu-
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously
mentioned, communication, Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he was
suftering from kidney disease. He died on October 21, 2005.

According to Rogers (1996), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is commu-
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
sion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 409).
That is, by sharing communication channels such as interpersonal communication or mass commu-
nication people can get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation as useful. Lasswell
(1948) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, §-M-C-R-E
(e.g., sender-message-channel-receiver-effect), Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this S-M-C-R-E commu-
nication model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender

can be inventors or opinion leaders, (27) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally
(5) the effects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion theory, ‘Time’ variable
is a very important factor. According to Rogers (1995), time variable is involved in diffusion in ae)
the innovation-decision process; (2) innovativeness; (3) an innovations rate of adoption. Most inno-
vations have an S-shaped rate of adoption. Diffusion research has attempted fo explain the variables
that influence how and why users and audience adopt a new Information medium, such as the Internet.
According ta evolution of media technology, interpersonal Influences are important! even though in the
past the individual is usually the unit of analysis, Also, critical mass becomes an important factor in
adopting new media because new media are interactive tools and thus are required Ay merry users to
gain efficiency, That is, the more peaple use, the more people get benefits, fn this sense, diffusion
theory not only can apply to practical things, but also can be related to digital altetete. |
There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to a ia

there are five stages.
