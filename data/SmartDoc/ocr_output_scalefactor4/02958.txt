I. NEEDS AND GRATIFICA ITONS

Five basic assumptions were stated] in

They provide a framew study of Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch in

ork for understanding the 1974 as follows.

certain kinds of content have to offer the audience

In the mass com munication process much initiative in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on

thear izing about any form of straight-line effect of media content on attitudes and
behavior,

- The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction. The needs served by
Mass COMMuNIcation constitute but a segment of the wider range of human needs,
and the degree to which they can be adequately met through mass media consump-
tion certainly varies.

. Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- Le., people
are sufficiently self-aware to be able to report their interests and motives in
particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with them in an
intelligible and familiar verbal formulation.

Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms. (p. 15-17).

In addition, Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch also com mented that, although previous researches on
gratifications detected diverse gratifications that attract peaple on the media, they did not address the
connections between these gratifications (Katz et al,, 1974a). They suggested that uses and ead
