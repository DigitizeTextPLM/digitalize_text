L CONCLUSION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE THEORIES

Underatanding of the public, and the secessity of attention-generating propaganda in Enfluencing
public opinion (Bermaye, 1986, p22). Bernava (UKi5) himself male a statement regarding his phrase.
the enginerring of coment, He said, Engineering implies planning. And it le careful planning more
than arvthing else that distinguishes modern public relations from old-time hit or miss Poblicity and
propaganda (Bernays, L055, p.22). Furthermore, Bernays theories aleo represent a different view of
the formation of public opinion. Im opposition to Lippaaann, who views the public as Bring easily
manipulated, Bernays ceations against thie, He aims, The pablic is not an amorphous mass which
can ‘be molded at will or dictated to [Bernays, 1928, » 66]. Instead, Bernays (1928) olfers the dea
thal in altempling to ifinenc the poblic, a bsiness must study what tenn the partnership can be
made amicable and matunlly beneficial. [¢ must explain iteelf, ite aime, ite ahjectives, to the
prot: ls berms whieh the public can underetard and ie willimg to aecept [p. Gb)_
Bernas elaborates on these dean in Public Relations (1982). Hather than merely attempting ta
manipulate the poblic throagh propaganda, Bernays presents public relations as a tool that con be
used to combine the ideas of the pute sed the perauader. The ohjective minded public relaticns
man helps his chant adjust to the contemporary siteation, or helps the public adjust to it (Bernays,
1982. pF). Bernays view of the public is eefter than that of Lippmann, as he recognizes the power of
society, bot still also claims that maniqelation of the public is poadbke. Bernaya (1952) writes of the
tenehies of poblie relations, To tise in general, public relations is important hecwuse it helps them
to wulertiand the sooty of which we ae all a part, to know and evaluate the viewpoint of others,
bo exert lemdorship in modifying conditions that affects en. to reakeate efforts being made by others,
anu to pera of sigerst course of action [p 10). Useder thie freamework, while manipralation of
the pablle ie still posible, it is mot in such blitsrt ignorance of the public opinion, Theorists euch a=
Lipptnaca and Eval tended to diaagren path this point.
