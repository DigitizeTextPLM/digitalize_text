Rogers was born in Carroll, kewa in 1991. Heeamed his BLA. M.A. aed Ph.O. degrees from Iowa
State University, Fortwo years during the Kerean War, he served in the US, Air Force. Interestingly,
in 186, he workin! on soe family planning communication projects in Korea.

The book has become the standard letheok on diffusion theory and it ereats applications of dilfu-
sion theory in such fields as geography, economics, payehology, political srience, and, as previously
mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2104 Because he wens
suffering from kidney diserese. He died on October 21, 2008.

According to Regers (1995), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innowation is commu-
nicated thrvagh certain chasnels aver time among the members of a social system. Am Lenoverion
is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffu-
shom of innovations involves both mess media and inenpersonal communication chanmels” ip, +047).
That is, by sharieg, communication channels such as interpersonal communication of mass commu-
nication people can get iafornation of an innovation and pereeive its inmovetion as useful. Lasevwedl
(1948) presented a well-known model of comevanication that is analyzed as five parts, S-hH4O-R-E
(e.g. sender-messape-channel-receiver-effect), Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this S-MC-R-E commu-
nication aiedel comesponds closely to the elements of diffuskm (p. 19). Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors a opinion leaders, (2) message can be a mew idea or peoduct, (7) chaneels can ihe
interpersonal or mass communication, (4) receivers can be members of & social system, ama finally

| (3) the effects can be individual's adoption ar social change. In the diMfesion tuecery, “Time” variable
is a very imporant factor. According to Regers (1995), time variable is invelved in diffusion in (1}
the inmcwvation-decision process; (2) imeovativences; (3) an innovation's rate of adoption. Mist inno
witions have ant S-shaped rate of adoption. Oyfievon newenct Aas auerioed fo egnlain fe variables

There ore five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according $0 inmowaliveness:
“( 1) inuatces (verturesome), (2) Barly Adopters (respectabie), (3) Early Majocity (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical), and (4) Laggards (ereditional” (Rogers, 1995, pp. 189-183). Rogers defined
