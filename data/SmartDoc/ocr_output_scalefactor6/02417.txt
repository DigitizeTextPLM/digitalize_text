is produced thraugh a process of selegion and combinaion of siged along two aaa, the syntagmatic

[e.g a sentence) and the paradignatic (a.g., synonyms), ongacined into-a signitying system” (Barker,

7002, p 28). As a grammatical set of signs or the underlying ayetamelic order, the ayrtag-
math comprises @ sentence, and the paradigmatic meana « field af possible signs that can

be replaced with ane another. Despite various poaaibiliies in delecting the signs within the
same paradigmatic, the selection is also regulabed by fhe cecrendare of linguistic community
members. Foran cxaenple of the syntagmalic and the paradigmatic, lets consider the fallow-

linear combination of signs. The signe wilhin the example, such as | theater, my, and getiend canbe

Through the syntagmatic and the paradigmatic, Saussure tells us thet signe are operaind ony ae
