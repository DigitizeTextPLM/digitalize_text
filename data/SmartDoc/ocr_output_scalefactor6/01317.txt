i the United States (Adorno, 1993, p 21), and gave a radio talk in Germany im L963 on The
Culture Industry Reconsidered. In 1966, when writing the exay Transparencia on Film,
Adores conceded that film-making might be an acceptable valvaral practioe in opposition to
the culture industry, within the context of modernism (Hobendahl, 1905, p. 11).

2 One-Dimensional Man, and Suppression of The Culture
Industry

Marcew pat an analysis of late capitalist soclety into a syetemalc: context, as opposed tir
other writers io the Prankfurt School (Wiggreshaus, 184, p. 600), Instead of culvare serving
ideokgical en, fir Marcuse social control meckanians bo advanced imdustrial aociety ansire
the whoksale integration of the individual into mesa enckty (Rieltx, 2000, p. 144), Caqitaltat
production and the tremendkes wealth that resulted from it formed a system of repressive
afHuence that kept ckments of society satieled amd quiescent (Alway, 1995, p. 83). The
entirety of society had become organized area! an ideclogy whose main objectives were ty
maintain social control and continue to perpetoste the ideohouy that guaintalned that control.
Echoing Adorno, Marco worrkral whather the information and entertainment aspects

(Marcisn, 1901, p @), However, ie is difficult in Marcuse: argument bo separate aaltur

meta a3 parities separate fram the totality of dominant Hleology im the fame way that Adorno
hud done, In the end Marcos analyaia of society allowed for no opposition to the dominant
ideghucy. Marcuse wrote, "how ean the adeninistered indiyidualevhe have made theic mudlation.

themeetes from themselves as well ae fron thelr asters? How is lt even thinkable that the

it 8 somewhat ironic that largely beewose of it he would be perveived as an icon for Ioftiet
movements of the 19006 lo the U.S. and Genmeany that developed an oppositional stance
[n spite of this, Mancuee maintained that he was a philosopoer, amd mot an activist. Like others
associated with the Frankfort School, he waa wary of the ides that theory coukd be translated
into practice (Chambers, 2004, p. 298).

Lo reviewing the tect in 1961, Friedrich Pollack repected to Adorno amd Horkheimer that the
work regained too mich rerisian to receive mass dissemination. The tou authors continued to
negotiate with the Placher pablishing house antil 1989, and may bare only agreed to republish
the work since pirate copies had already heen disseminated by individuals.
