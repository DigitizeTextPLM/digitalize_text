1 Needs and Gratifications

Uses and pratifications aparoach ernphasizes motives and the self-perceived needs of audience mem-
bers. Blumlerand Kate (1974) concluded that different people can use the same communication mes-
cape for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify different needs for different
individuals. There is not only ane way that people uses media. Comtrarily, tere are as many reason
for using the media as there are media users (Blumer & Katz, 1974),

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, interests, arid
education, affect people's ideas about what they want fram media and which media best meet their
feeds. That is, audkence members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratificabians
for using diferent media. hicQuail, Blumer, and Brown (1972] proposed a model of “media-person

Another subdivided version ofthe audience's motivation was suggested by MeGuire (1974), based

ona general theory of human raecs. He distrgushed beraven two types of needs: cognitres ars

affective. Than he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus
“internet” goal afantation, and emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation.” Wher charted,

these factors eld 16 different types of motivations which apply to media use (Figure 1). Figure 1. A

[1973] developed 55 reeds taken from the social and psychalagical functions af the mass Tends and
