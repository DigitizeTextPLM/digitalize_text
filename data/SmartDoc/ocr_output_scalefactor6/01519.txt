aus. crilicisma of the text, not least since Adome made sweeping generalizations afoul “ihe
commodified and fetishiged character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1985, p. 112). Por the
ganarally symoathetic Deborah Cook, Adamo erred in not digcussing the processes. of cul:
tural production, and tated to examine the cullure industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and acwertsing (Cook, 1996, p. 48).

linving that “capitalet society languishes in the grip of an all-parvasive reificalion’ (Eagleton,
1841. p, 46). Still, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
