According to Rogers (1980). diffusion refers to “the process by which an Lnnoention is commu-
nicated through certain channels over time among dhe members of a social system. An Innereeticn
is an idea, peactice or object perceived as new by an individual oc other unit of adoptiom. The didtu-
sion of innowations invahars beth mass media and imerpersonal eammunicanon chermels” (fp. 405).
That is, by sharing communication charieh such as interpersonal communication or mia commis
nication people cin get information of an innovation and perceive its innovation ws exelll Lasswell
(144) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-MoC-R-E
(e.g., sendermesiage-channel-receivereffect), Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this $-M-C-R-E commu
nication model coreespareds closely io the ekements of diffusion” (p. 1%), Specifically, (1) sender
can he investors or opinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
inlerperscnial of mass COMIMUNCAtON, (4) receivers Gin be members of a social system, and finally
(3) the effects can be individual's adoption or social charge. In the diffusion theory, “Time” variable

| Then: are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according to Innovativeness:
(1) Innowators (venturesome), (2) Early Adopters (respectable), (7) Early Majority (Deliberate), (4)
Late Majority (skeptical, and (5) Laggares (traditional ” (Rogers, 1993, pp. 183-195). Rogers. defined
this term a6 “the degre: to which an individual i relatively earlier in adopeing new bess thes other
