1.1. Introduction

Uses and gratifications approach is an indizential frackbon in media research, The orginal
conception of the approach was based on the reeearch for explaining the great appeal of
certain media contents. The core question af auch research is: Why do people use macecdia
and what do thery use them for? (McQuall, 1984). There eaists a basic dea in tits approach:
audience members kigw media coment aed which media they can use to mee hear needs.
In ihe mass communication process, uses and gratifications approach pats the furction od
firming need gratificatians and media choice cary on the side of audience members. Mi
suggest that people's needs influence what media they would choose, how they use cer
tain media and what gratifications the media give them. The approach diers trom offer
theoretical persoecthves in that it regards audiences as active media users as apposed 1p
passive moeivers of information. in contrast to traditional media effects Iheores whech focus

fons appfaach is more concemed With what people de with media’ (Katz, 1959). It alkiws
audiences pafacnal needs io use Meck and responds to the media, which determined by
heir social and psychological background. Uses and gratdicatocrs approach also pastulaias
