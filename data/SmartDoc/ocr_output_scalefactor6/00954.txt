Uses and pratifications approach emphasizes motives and the self perceived needs of audience mer
bers. Blunder and Kata (1974) concluded that diferent people can use the same communication mes:
shan for vary diferent purposes. The same medis content may gratify different needs for differen
individuals. There is not anhy ore way that paople uses media, Coevtrarily. there are as many reasons
for using the media as there are media users [lurdar & Katz, 1974],

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experience, inberwsts, and
education, atfect people's mivas about what they want from media and which media best meet thee
needs, Thetis, eudience members are aware of and can state their owe motives and grasifications
for using different media. MoQuail, Blumer, and Brown (1972) proposed 4 model of “meda-person
Inberactiors” to classihy four important media gratifcations: (1) Diverse: ettage fram roubre or
problens; emotienal reload; (2] Personal relationships: companionship; soctal ublity; (3] Persona

Ancaher subdivided version of the audience's motiwation was suggested by Mecuaire |2974), based
on a general theary of human needs. He distinguished beteoen two types of needs: cognitive and
affective, Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external versus
“internal” goal orientation, and amation stability of “growth” and “preservation.” Wien charted,
these factors yield 16 different types of motieations which apply to med use (Figure 1]. Figure 1. 4
Structuring of 16 general paradigers of human motration (Moguire, 1974), Katz, Gurevich and Has
(1973) developed 35 needs taken from the social and paychological functions of the mass eedig and
