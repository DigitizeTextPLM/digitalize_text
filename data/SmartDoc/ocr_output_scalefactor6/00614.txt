According to Rogers (195), diffusion reers to “the process by which an innovation is commu-
nicated through cemee channels over time among the members of a social aystem. Am Innovation
is an ides, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other emit of adoption. The dilTu-
chon of Innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” (p. 05).
That is, ty shoring communication channels such as intespersonal communication or mass Gomme
nication people can get information of an isnowation and perceive its imecwation as useful, Lasswell
(142) presented a wellenown model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, $-M-C-R-E

Late Majority (skeptical, and. (5) Loggords (ireditbonal)" (Rogers, [90S pp. 1339-19). Rogers defined
