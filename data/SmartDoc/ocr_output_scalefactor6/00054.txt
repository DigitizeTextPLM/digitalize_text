1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty bas been Klentified as an imporant construct, necessary to the study of commu

axpanded the concept of uncerainty to fit interpersonal communication bey defining uncertainty as
the “hunter of alernative ways in which each interactint might behave" (p. 100). The greater the
