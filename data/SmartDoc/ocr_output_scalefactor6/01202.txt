1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language tranalation mared the first real appearance of the idea of the
cullure induatiry oulaide of a German context. in the years since tere have been nuner-
ous crilieme of the text. not least since Adomo made sweeping generalizations about “the
commodified and éatishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996. p. 113). For the
peneraly sympathelic Deborah Cook, Adame erred in not descussing the prooasses of cub
tural production, and failed ic examine the culture industry's ecancenic dependence an other
business seciors, including marketing and acwertising (Cook, 1996, p. 4B).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated (ve dominant ideology, be-
herving thal “capitalat society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagiedan, .
4991, p. 46). Stil, Eagleton conmeded that “the diffusion of domunans values and beliefs fu
amvang oppressed paoples in society has some part io play in the reproduction of the sys |
bem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1994. p. 36). Fredric Jamasen pointed out that Adornos Kea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the society that dewalaped in the 19605
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available dunng the 1S4ds.

appear io be merely historical, if they in fact cevoeded that it had any value al ail. ee
Thus for aon orifices modernist warks would be counteracting forces against the dominart ;
