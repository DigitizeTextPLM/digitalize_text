1 Early Influences

The following thenrists significantly contributed to the exasisation of uncertainty in comevenication.
The influence of their work can be seen reflected im the auumptions of Berger and Calabrese (L973),

1.1) Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology atthe University of lian under the direction of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,
one of the founders of social psychology and a pioneer in the research of growp dynamics, had a sub
stantial influence on the development of interpersonal communication, After gradwatiom, initially
worked at the University of Rochester, but in 1945 he followed Lewin 0 Massachesetts [nsel-
bate of Techmokey and dhe Rescarch Center for Groap Dynamics. Afier Lewin dewth, Festinger
worked al the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the Mew School for Socal Research
(Samelson, 2000), Much of Festinger's research followed his mentor Lewin amd further deweloped.
Lewin's thecrics, Several of Festinger theorkes were highly infleential oe the emerging field of in-
herpeninal communication and on ihe development of UBT, Festinger i¢ best known for the theories
of Cognitive Dissetamce and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance: theory (CIT) attempted to
explain how am imbalano: asong cognitions might affect an individual, Lewin foreshadowed CDT
in his observations regarding alitade change in amall groups (Festinger, [2), CIT allows tor three
relationships to occur among engnilions: a consonant relationship. in which cognitions are in equi-
Reeium with each other; a dissonant meblionship, in which cognitions are in competition with each
other; and an ielevant relationship, in which the cagnilions in question hawe no effect on ome another
(West & Tumer, 2000) Cognitive Dissonance. like uncertainty, hes at clement of arvasal and dis-
comfboct that individuals see% to reduce. Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals beak ho
fredhack from others to evekerle their performance and abilities, To evaluate the self, the individual

eal comparison io URT by stating thal “Festinger has suggested that persons seek out similar oghers

their behavior and or opinions in a petticuler situates” (p. LOT). Festinger received the Distinguished
Scientist award ofthe American Psychological Assocation and the Deectinguished Senter Scientist
Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Pestimger's kgocy is significant, and
his theoretical influenes can still be recognized in contemporary social sciemce research. Aronson (in
Festinger. 4) stated, “It was in this era Chat Loon Festinger inwermed and developed his theary of
cagaitlve dissonance, and in ery opimicn, social peychology has not been the same since" (p. 3).
