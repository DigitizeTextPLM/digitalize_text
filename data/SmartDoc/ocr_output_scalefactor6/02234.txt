1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of ihe idea of the
culture industry outside of a German context. In the years since thare have been numer
ous criticisms of the teat, not last since Adora made sweeping goneraizationg about “the
commodified and fefiahized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1995, p. 4114). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Ceok, Adome ered in mat discussing the procetaes of cul
tural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing ard acwertising (Cook, 1995, p. 48).

For Tary Eagievion, both Adome and Marcuse overestimated the dominart dealogy, be-
lieving that “capitalat society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reificabon (Eagleton,
1991, p. 46). Stil, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
among oppressed peoples in sociely has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys-
bem as a whole” (Eagkton, 1991, p. 26). Fredric Jameson pointed out thal Agone's idea
ef a qulbure indusiry was historically limited, since the society that developed im the 18508
and 7970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities avaiable during the 140s.
VWhile fhe idea of the oulbure industry can ba dedanded as a usedul heory for indusinal scm-
cies bebween 1920 and 1970, trying to use # ioday weakens fs affectveness (Hohedanl,

Thus for some critics moderniel works would be counteracting forces agains the dominant
ideology, As noted in ihe example of Orson Valles, however, it may be fhe case that the
dominant declooy can co-opt modemial works for its geno ends. The idea of the culture
