According to Rogers (1998), diffusion refers to “the process by which an innovation is Gommu-
nicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system, An Innovation

is as iden, practice or object perceived as mew by an individual or oeher unit of adoption. The dilfu-
sion of innovations involves both mass media ard interpersonal communication channels” (p. 405}.
That is, by sharing cotirwnicarie channels such as interperketal communication of ease commu

(1998) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, S-M-C-R-E
(e.g., sender-message-channebreceiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “this $-M-C-R-E commu-
nicaies model ccerespands closely in the elements of diffusion” {p. 19. Specifically, (1) sender
can be inventors or opinion ieaders, (2) message can be a new idea of product, (3) chaneels cas be
