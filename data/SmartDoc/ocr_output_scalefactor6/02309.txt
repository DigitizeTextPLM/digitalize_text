Like many other structuraist scholars, Barthes was inuenced by Saussure afnuctural lireuistics.
To Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operates an two levels, the ayshamatic syeiem and the vanation
oy speaking actors. The former ig called langue afd te latter pardie. Langue is the syalamatzed set
of comventions necessary to Goterunication, indifferent to the matenal of the signal which compose
i: as opposed bo if, speech (parce) is covers the purely individual part of language” (Barthes. 1957,
5.12). Garthes interprets Saussures inguistic systam vathin the eocial dimension, The structure level,
langue, is the social convertion or value shared Ihrough a society which is stabilized and standangized.
On the contrary, parole ib fandble because it ie fhe actual expreseion atthe individival level. Poveenwed

A language ia therefore, -a socal insttulion and a system of values. F is fe social part of
language, it is eatentially a collective contract which ons eral accept in ity antivaty if one

Ficuging on the systemalic bevel Sausure deinguahes the language eye into two parts, fe
signified and the signifier The signified is a conoaptor meaning wich is expensed through the fare
The form is called the signifier, which i the extemal part of language For example, both fe word
dog in Enghah or in Korean are the extemal farms expresaing the actual animal dog. Here, ee actual
animal, ihe concept in quesiian, Sacomes the signified, “I propose ip retain fe word sign (signe) bo
designate fhe whole and bo replace concept amd sounchimage reepeciivealy by signified (sgnifie) arud
signifer (aigniheant); the last ten terra have the advantage of indicating the opposilie thal sapa-
tales them trom eech olher and trom the whole of which they are parts” (Sueur, 7259. in FR. Innis

(e.g. a sentence) and the paradigmatic (e.g., aynenyms), organized into a signifying system” (Barker,
2002, 9 29) As a grammatical aet of signs or the underlying systematic order, the syntag-
matic coenprives @ sentence, and the paradigmatic means a field of possible signs that can
be replaced with one another, Despite various possibilities in selecting the signa within the
same paradigmatic, the selection ts also regulated by the consensus of linguistic community
members. Far an tcoample of the ayntagmatic and the paradigmatic, leta consider the follow-
