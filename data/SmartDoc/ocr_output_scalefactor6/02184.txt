Foousing on the systematic level, Saueurre distinguishes the language system into hwo parts, the
signified and the signifier. The signified is a. concept or mesring which is expressed Srough the form.
The form 6s called the aigeiher, which is the extemal pert of language. For smample, boih thee word
