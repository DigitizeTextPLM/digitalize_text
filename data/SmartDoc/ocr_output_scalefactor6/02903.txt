4 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 Engishdanguage transiafion marked the first real  spelatnes by she pt
cullure industry outside of a German contest. in the years since thera Nave beer

generally sympathatic Deborah Cock, Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cul-
qural production, and tailed ta examine Se culture industry's aconomic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertiging (Cook, TSO6, p. 48).

Far Terry Eagleton, bot Adorno and Marcus overealimated the daminarit sackouy, be-
ligving that “capitalist society languiahes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleson,
1907, p. 44). Stil, Eagleton conceded thal “the diffusion of dominant values and beliets
among oppressed peoplas in society has some part io play in the reproduction af the sys-
tem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p, 36) Fredric Jameson poinied out that Adorno's ida
of a culture industry was historically lirviied, sina tha society that developed im the 160
and 1970s with new media went beyond the cultural poeaibiliies available during tha 14415.

industry has had an impenance in critical theory since its appearance in the 1940s, in that
