He complained io the dean about the radical students in his classes who were making

1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culture industry outside of a German context. in the years since there have been numer
ous criliciams of ihe text, rot mast since Adore made sweeping generalzabons about “the
cormmedified and fetishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1996, p. 173). For the
generally sympathetic Deberah Cook, Adora ered in not discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and failed to axamine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including markeling and advertsing (Gack, 1996, p. 44).
Foe Terry Eagheton, both Adare and Marcuse overestimated the dominant idealogy, be-
lquing that “caphalel society languishes in the grip of an al-pervasre reification” (Eagleton, |
45041. p. 46). Stil, Eagleton comoaded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
among oporessed peaples in society has some part to play iv the raproduction of Ihe Sye-
fem 36 a whole” (Eagleton, 19681, 9, 36). Predne Jameson pointed out that Adomo's ides a
of & cuflure industry was historically limited, since the society that developed in the 1960s
and 1970s with new media weed bayord the cultural possibilities available ducing the 1408. 4
While the idea of the cultura industry can be defended as a useful theory for mduetrial eeci- :
cles between 1520 and 1970. irving i ues it today weakens its efectveneds (Hahendal, _—
