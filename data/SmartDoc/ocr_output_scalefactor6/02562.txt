Like many ofvar structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure structural linguistics.

Focusing on the systematic level, Bausurme distinguishes the: language ayalam into wo parts, ire
signified and the signifier, Tha signified isa conmaplor maaning which ie eeprediad through the fore,
The form is called Ife signifier, which ws ihe extemal part of language. For example, both the word
