1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1872 English-language translation marced the firet real appaarance of the idea of the
culture induetry oulaide of a German context in the years since there have been numer
ous criliceme of the text, not inast since Adome made sweeping generalizations about “the
commodified and tatishized character of all cultural goods" (Cook, 1998, p. 173). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adome ened in not decussing the pronasses of cul-
tural production, and failed to examine the cullure industry's econornic dependence on aller
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996, p. 4B).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adorno and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, be-
heving that “capitaliet somety languishes in the gr of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleson,
1991, p. 46) Stil, Eagleton comoeded that “the diffueean of domenant values and beliefs
among oppressed paoples in soety has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys-
bem asa whole” (Eagleton, 199%. p 36). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adornos Kea
af a culture industry waa. historically limited, since the society that developed in the 19506
and (970s with new media went beyond the cultural possibilities available during the 154s.
While the idea of fhe culture indusiry can be dedended as a usedtul theory for indisinal soc.
elies bebweee 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectvenses (Hoherdaril,

1986, p. 146-48) Thus, fora some crilies, the value of the idea of the culture industry would
apoear io be menely historical, if they in fact corroded that it had any value at ail.

Thus for sore orifices modernist works would be counteracting forces against the dominant
ideology. Ag nebed in the example of Orson Wells, however, & may be the case that the
dominant ideology can co-ool modemisat works for iis own ends. The idea of the culture
industry has had an importance if critical theary since fs appearance in the 18a0s, in that

industry, aed since ha did not systematically explore how the culbure induairy operated, it has
been generally aasy for some to demise the idea of a cultura indugiry, Iti manetheees the
