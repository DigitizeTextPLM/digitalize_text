1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

generally eyfmathatic Detarah Cook, Ahora erned in reat discuscang the processes of cul-
qural productos, and failed to examine the cullare industry's economic dependence on ather
business seciars, indluding marketing and advertising [Cook 1896, p. 46).

For Tesry Eagieton, both Adama and Marcuse overnstimated the dominant iddeclagy, Be-
having that ‘capitalist society tenguignes in ihe grin cf ari all-pe reserve rarication (Eagleton,
1991, p. 46). StL Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of daminant values and beliele
among oppressed pecgies in society hae fome part Ip play in the nepraduction of ihe sys-
iam as a whole" (Eagieian, 1997, p 38). Fredric Jameson pointed out that Adorno’s idea
of a culture industry was historically limited, since the sockty that developed jin the 1960s
and 1970s with new media went boyond the cultural possibilities available during the 1540s.
while ihe idea of the culture mdusiry can be defended as a useful theory for indusinal soci-
elies between 1920 and 1970, trsing to use il today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahll,
1665, 0. 146-468), Thus, tora some critics, the value of he dea ol the culhane industry would
apoear to be merely historical, if they in fact conceded that it had any value al all.

Thus for some orifices modernist works would be counteracting forces agains the dominant
ideology. As noted in the example of Oreon Welles, however, il inary be lhe cage that the
dominant ideology can co-opt modeniet works for its own ends. The idea of the culture
industry has had an importance in critical theory since && appearance in ihe 19408. in that
