Focusing on the systemalic level, Sausurte distinguishes the anguage syste ih bavi parts, Tet
signified and the signifies, The signified is a conpeptor meaning which a aepriseed through ihe form
The form ia called the signifier. which is the extemal par of language. For example, Both ihe word
dog in English or in Korean are the extemal forms expressing he acluel afimal dog. Hooe, the actual
animal, tre concept im queaiion becomes the signified. “| preposa to retain the word gign (ampne} to

Behwenn the signs that operates ffee signifying system, Saussure (1S) argues that “language does
