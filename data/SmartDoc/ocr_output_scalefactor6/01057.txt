Lise many other siructurabet acholars, Barthes was infiuanoed by Saves’ alnuctural linguistics.
To Saussure, tha linguistic mechanism operates on bey lewels, the gysermalic system and the variation
by apadking actors. The dormer is called langue and thea lather parcte. Langue is the eyetertalizad set
of comrentions necessary fo communication, ifaiferant to the material of the signal whion compose
it; as oppoeed fo il, seaach (parole) is covers the purety individual part of language” (Barthes, 1067.

Focusing on tha systematic level, Saugunm distinguishes the language system iris feeds femerdss, thie:
signifed and the signifier. The signified is a concept or mxaning which & cupreséad through de form
The form is called the signifier, which is the eclemal part of language. For aeample, both the word
dog in English af in Korean are the extemal forms expressing the actual animal dog. Here, the eetual

designabe the whole and to replace concept ad sounchimage rescechvely try signified (sigeife) and

Through the ayifitepimatic and the paradigmatic, Baussure tells us thal signs are operdied only when
