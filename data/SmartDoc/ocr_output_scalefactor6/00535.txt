Rogers was born in Carroll, lewa in 1931, He eamed his BA. M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from [owa
State University. For two years during the Korean War, he served in the U.S. Air Force. Interestingly,

in 1466, be worked on some family planning communication projects in Korea,

The book has become the standard textbook on diffusion theory and it crents applications of diffu-
hon theory in such fields as geography, economics, psychology, political science, and, as previously
Mentioned, communication. Rogers retired from University of New Mexico in 2004 because he wis
suffering from kidney disense, He died on October 21, 2005,

According ta Rogers (1996), diffuston refers to “the process by which an innewvadtion is comma-
nicated theowgh certain channels ower time among the members of a social system. An Innervation
is an idea, practice of object perceived as new by an individual or other unet of adoption. The diffu-
sion of inmovalions volves both mass media and interpersonal communication chaneels" (p. 409).
Thea. is, by sharing communication channels such as interperstew! communication or mass comma

nication people can gel mlonmacion of an inmcwation and percelve its innovation as usefal, Lasswell

(LOLS) presented a well-known model of communication that is analyzed as five parts, 5-M-CR-E

(e.g., sender-message-chanmel-receiver-effect). Rogers (1995) mentioned, “thes §-M-C-R-E commu-

mcatiogs model corresponds closely to the elements of diffusion” ( 19). Specifically, (1) sender

cam be inventors oe epinion leaders, (2) message can be a new idea or product, (3) channels can be
imerpersonal or mess communicatkm, (4) receivers can be members of a social system, and finally

(5) the elects can be individual's adoption or social change. In the diffusion whecey, “Tinse* verable

There are free different types of adopters im ihe diffusion process, according 0 Innovanivencss:

this term ae “the depree bo whiols an individual is relatinely earlier in adopting mew idea than aber
