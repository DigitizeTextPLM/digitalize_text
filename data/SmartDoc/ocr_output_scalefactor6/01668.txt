Focusing on the systematic kval, Sausurre distinguishes the language syétam int bwo parts, the
signified and the signifier, Tha signified is a conoapl or meaning which expressed through the finn.
The form is called fhe signifier, which is the eodemal part of baring For example, both the word
dog in Engliah or in Korean ane the eeeenal forms expressing the actual animal dog. Hare, the accel
