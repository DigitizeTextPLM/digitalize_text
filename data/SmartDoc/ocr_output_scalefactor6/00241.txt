1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translatien marked the first real appearance of the kiea of the
culture industry outside of a German contest, In the years since there have been nurner-
cus criticisms of the beat, nol last since Adamo made sweeping generalizations about “ihe
enmnmodified and fetishaed character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1996, p. 173). For the
generally symoathetic Deborah Cook, Adora erred in nat discugsing the processes of cul
hural production, and falled to examine the culture induatry's economic dependence on olher
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Gack, 1996, p. 46).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adamo and Marcuse owereslimated tha dominant ideology, be-
feving thed “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all: pervasive reification” (Eagleten,
1901, p 46). Still, Eagleton concected that Whe ditfusion of dominant values and beliefs
among oppressed peoples in sociely has some part to play in the regraduction of the sys-
tem as a whole” (Eagieton, 1991, p. 36) Fredric Jameson poingead cut that Adorno's idea i eee
ed a cuhure industry wes historically limmed, since the society thal developed in the 1940s arr ar
and 1970s with new madia went beyord ihe cullural possiblities available during the 19408. ! i
While the idea of the culbure industry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial soci
eles bebveen 1920 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens its effectiveness (Hohendahl,

1055, p. 146-405). Thus, tora some critics, the value ofthe idea of the culture industry would
Sppear to be merely historical, if hey in fact conceded thet if had arty value af all,

Thus forsome critics eadenniat works would be counteracting forces against the dominant
ideclegy. Ae noted in the exargie of Orson Wellas, however, it may be the case that the
dominant ideoiogy can co-opt modernist works for ts can ends. The idea of the culture
