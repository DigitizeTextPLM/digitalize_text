Edward Bemays (1691-14) was examining poblic relations, propequinda, and public opindon. Bamiays [LS2H)
defines pmpegandla as, a consistent. enduring effort to create or shape ewes 0 Influence the celatlors of a

that propaganda can be eber beneficial or harmful oo the public. it can help individuals decide whet oo think
