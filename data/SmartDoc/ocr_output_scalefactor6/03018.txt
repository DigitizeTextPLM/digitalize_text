1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language tamsiatian marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culbure industry cutside of a Geman context In the years since there hawe been nurner-
ous Grilicisms of the bet, not least since Adomo made sweeping generalizations about “the
commodified and felishized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1998, p. 113). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adama ered in net discussing the processes of cul-
tural production, and failed to examine the cuiure industry's economic dapendence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Conk, 1996, p45)

For Terry Eagleton, bath Adena and Marcuse overestimaled the Gaminant meolgy, be-
heving that “capitalist society languishes in the gnp ofan all-pervaaive redication” (Eagleton,
1991, p. 46). St, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and belefs
amang oppressed peoples in sockrty has some part to play in the reproduction of thm sys-
jem as a Whole” (Eagleton, 1997, p. 36), Fredne Jameson pointed out that Adonna's ina
of a culture indusiry was historically limited, since the scciely tal developed in the 19508
and 18706 with naw media went beyond the cullural possibilities available during the 14ds.
While the idea of the culture industry can be detended as a useful theory for rdusinal soo-
alies betwnen 1920 ard 1970, trying bo use it ioday weakens fs effectiveness (Hohendahl,
1995, 6. 146-48). Thus, fora some critics, the value of the idea of the culture induatry would
