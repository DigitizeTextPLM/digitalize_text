1 Needs and Gratifications

Lises and gratifications approach emphasizes motives and the sel perceived needs of audience rier
bars, Blumer and Kate (1974) concluded that different people can use the sane communitation mes-
sage for very different purposes. The same media content may gratify diferent needs for diferent
individuals, There is not only one way that peopla uses media. Combrarily, there ane as many reasons
dor using the media as there are media users |Baurnler & Katz, 1974). ,

Basic needs, social situation, and the individual's background, such as experiance, interests, and
education, alect people's kdeas about what they want from media and which media best meet their
feeds. That is, audience members are aware of and can state their own motives and gratfications
for using different media. McChuail, Blumler, and Brown (1972) propased a madel of “media-person
interactions” bo classify four important media gratiications: (1) Civerston: escape from routine ar
protienms: eerotianal ralnase; (2| Personal reletionships: companionship; social utility; (3) Personal
identity: se# reference: eality euploration; value reinforces; and (4) Survedlance {fanms of informa-
ton seeking).

Another wbdivided version of the audience's motivation was suggested by McGuire (1974), based
on a general theory of human needs. He dishinguished between two types ol heels: cognitive and
affective. Then he added three dimensions: “active” versus “passive” initiation, “external” versus
“miemal goal onentabon, acd emotion stability of “growth” and “preservation.” When charted,
trese factors yield 16 dierent types of mottwations which apody to media use (Figure 2). Figure 1. A
