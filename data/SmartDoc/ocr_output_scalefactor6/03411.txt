1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translatien marked the first real appearance of the Kea of fe
quibure industry outside of a German contest, In the years since here have Oeen numer-
cus criticisms of the teat, nol last since Adamo made sweeping generalizations about “the
eommedified and fetishited character of all cullural goods” (Cook, 1996, p. 1173). Por tie
generally symoathetic Deborah Cook, Adorno erred in nat discussing the processes of cul
tural production, and failed to eamaming the culture indueiry's economic dependence on olhar
business sectors, including marketing aed advertising (Gack, 1996, p. 4B).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adamo and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, be-
heving thet “capibalist sockety languishes in tie grip of an all-pervasiwe reificatian” (Eagleton,
1901, p 46). Sill, Eagleton concecked that Whe di@tusion of dominant values and beliefs
among oppressed peoples in sociely has some part to play in the regraduction of the sys-
tem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36) Fredric Jameson poinged cut that Adorno's idea
of a culture industry was historically limmed, since the seciety thal developed in the 1980s
and 1970s with new madia went beyord ihe cullural possiblities available during the 19408.
