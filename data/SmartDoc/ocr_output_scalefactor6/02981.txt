As Lippmann was writing propaganda, Harold Laswell was undercard empirical analyses of propaganda. In
fan. wich of the pein 1 thai Laaswell was examining was actually being writen by Lippmann himself
(Rogers, 19015.

Harold Lasewall (1900-1973) war a prominent scholar in ihe area of peopaganda reuech. Ble focused cn
condocting both quantiative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the coment of propagasda,
and discrrvering the effect of pmpegandacnthe mass audience (Rogers, L994). Lasswell is credited with creating
the mass communication procedure of contem analysis (Rogers, 1994), Geracally, content analysts can be
defined as, "the [nvestigation of communication mixsapesby calegorscing message combint ino chysstficaltioas

Aside from undecwamiling the comentof peopaganda, Lasswell was also ieterested in how peopagarela could

fnierested in. examining the effects of thu media in ceeating pudC opinion within a democratic sysiem. In this
way, Lasswell has creed a cece, whereby the public is limited in the information that is pressed in them,
