|, DEFINING UNCERTANT

Research conducted under the tite of interpersonal communication initially focused on pervaaston,
social influence, and small groop processes, Theories exploeed the cole of learning, dissonance, bal-
ance, social judgment, and reactance (Rerger, 2005). Bart Lewin, a forefather of soctal paycholegy,
played a considerable pole in influencing inerpersonal research pitmeers such as Festinger, Heider,
Kelley, and Hoyland. By the 1970s, research imerests begam so shalt iene che realm of scial interaction,
relational development, and relational commal. This was influenced by che research of such scholars
as Knapp, Mehrabian, Altman, Taylor, Duck, Kelley, and Thibawt, Qocing the later part of the decade
and into the 1980s, the copnicive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Ralott, and Benger became popular
along with reseanch into behayioed! and communicative adaptation by Giles, Borgia, and Patterson.

1 Defining Uncertainty

Since uncertainty has bean Mentified as am important comsmnuct, necessary po the spody of como
nication, it would be beneficial to know when the concep! originated, anel hora it has Geen defined
and studied One way to consider uncertainty & through the theoretical framework of information
theory. Shannon and Weaver (1949) proposed that uncertainty exisied in a given stuaton when there
was a high amownr of possible alnonnatives and the poohabilicy of their event was relatively equal.
Shannon and “eee related this view of ace rinty bb the freneisin of messages, bot them work
also contributed to the development of URT. Berger and Calabrese (1975) adopied concepts from the
infermation thenrisrs as well as Helder (1555) research in atrlbutlon, Berger and Calabrese (1975)
expanded the concept of uncertainty 0 fit interpersonal Gammunication by defing wecectainty ws
the “number of alternative ways im which each imeracant might behave" (jp. 100), The greater the
lewel of uncertainty Chal exists i a simation, the smaller the chasoe individuals will be able vo pee-
dict behaviors and occurrences. During imeractions individuals are mot onby faced with problems of
predicting present and past behaviors, bur also explaining why partners behave or believe lm the way
that they do. Berger and Bradac’s (1982) defimetion of uncertainy highlighted the complexity of chis
process when ihey stated: “Uncertainty, then, can stem from the Lange eumiter of alternative things
that a dramger can belleve or potencially say" Uncertalney plays a significant role when examining
relatcmships. High levels of uncerainty can severely mbibit relational development. Uncertainty con

eclions imdviduals are expected to increase prectictability with the goal chat this will lead bo the abviliny
to predict and explain what will occur in funagre interactions, When bagh uncertainty exists it is often
diftical to reach this goal, Alchough indiveduals seek to reduce uncertainey, high levels of certainty
and peediciabiliry can also inhibit a relationship, Heach and Bryant (2000) sane: “Too much cectalnny
and predictability can deaden a relationships
