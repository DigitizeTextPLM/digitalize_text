1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translatien marked the first real appearance of the Kiea of the
cultura industry outside of a Geran conteod, In the years eince there have been numer
cus criticisms of the beat, nol last since Adamo made sweeping generalizations about “ihe
eommedified and fetishined character of all cullural goods” (Cock, 1996, p. 173). For the
generally symoathetic Deborah Cook, Adorno erred in not discussing the processes of cul-
hural production, and failed to examine the culture induairy's economic dependence on olher
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cock, 1996, p. 46).

For Terry Eagleson, both Adamo and Marcuse overestimated tha dominant ideclogy, be-
feving thet “capitalist society lguishes in the grip of an all: pereasive reification” (Eagleten,
1901, p 46). Sill, Eagleton concected that Ihe ditusion of dominant values and beliefs
among oppressed peoples in sociely has some part to play in the regraduction of the sys-
tem as a whole” (Eagieion, 1991, p. 36) Fredric Jameson poinded cut that Adorno's idea
of a cuure industry was historically limied, since the accety thal developed in the 1980s
and 1970s with new media went beyord ihe cullural possiblities available during the 19408.
While the idea of the culbune indueiry can be defended as a useful theory for industrial sexci-

eties bebween 1520 and 1970, trying to use it today weakens itp effectiveness (Hohendahl,
TOSS, p. 146-48). Thus, tora some crifics, the value ofthe idea of the culture industry would
appear ta be mesely historical, if they in fact conceded that il had aery value aft all,
Thus for some crits dentiat works would be counteracting forces agains the dominant
