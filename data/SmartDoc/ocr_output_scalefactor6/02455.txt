There are five different types of adopters in the diffusion process, according 1 Innovativeness:

Late Majority (skeptical), and (5) Lageards (traditionally (Rogess, |993_pp. 183-185), Rogers defined
this term as “the degree to which an individual is relatively earlier in adopting mew ideas than other
