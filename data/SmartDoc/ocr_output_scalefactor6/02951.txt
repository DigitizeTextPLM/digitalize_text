1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-anguage trarciatios marked the first real aopearance of the idea of the
Guilture industry outside of a German contest. In the years since there have been numer-
aus cnbcisms of the taxi, not least since Adomo mada sweeging geraralizatians about "the
comimedified and tetishized character of all cultural goods” (Cock, 1996, 9. 173). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adema erréd in nol discussing ihe proceases of cul-
tural pradwctkon, and filed io examine the cubune industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including maraeting and acwertising (Cook, 1554, p. 48).

For Terry Eagleton, both fidomeo and Marcuse owerestimated the dominant meology, be-
living that “capitalist society languishas in the grip of an all-pervasae reticabon” (Eagleton,
1981, p. 48). Sil, Eagleton conceded ihat “the ditusion of dominant values and beefs.
among oppressed peoples in sociely has some part to play in The repeoduchon of the sy5-
tem ah a whole” (Eagieton, 1951, p. 38). Frednc Jameson pointed out thai Adomos Waa

While the Wea of the culture indusiry can be detanded as a usedul theory for industrial #od-
aties between 1920 and 1970, trying to use it ioday weakens fs atfectveness (Hohendahl,
1695. 9, 14648). Thus, for a some ortics, the value of the idea of the cuibure industry would

industry has had an importance in critical theory since: its appearance in the 1840s, in that
