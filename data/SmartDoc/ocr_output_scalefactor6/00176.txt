Like many olher structuralist scholars. Barthes was influanced by Saussure structural linguistics.
Ta Saussure, the linguistic mechanism operabes on two bevels, ihe systematic eystem and the varalion
by speakierg actors. The former i called langue and the lather parole. Langue is he syshemetined set
of convenfians necessary io cammunication, indifferent to the material of fie signal which compose
it, as opposed ta it, speech (parole) is covers the purely individual part of language” (Barthes, 1B8F,
6.13). Barthes interprets Saugsures linguistic ayatem within the social dimension. The structure heal,
lanqui, is the sock convention orvalue shared through a society which is stabilized and standardized.
On the contrary, parole is fedble because it fe te actual expression at the individual level, However,
fis considered relatively flexible due to the fact that speech by an individual cannot be free from the
