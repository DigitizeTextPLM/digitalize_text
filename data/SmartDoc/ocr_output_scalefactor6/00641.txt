conception of the approach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of
certain media cantents, The cone question of such research is: Why do paopie use media
and what do they use them foe? (McGQuail, 1983). Tnere ests a basis dea in this approach:
audmoas members know media content and which media they can use bo peel ther needs
in the mass communication process, uses aed gratificatians approach puts the function of
inking need gralifications and media choice clearly on the side of audience members, It
suggests that peaple's needs influence what media they would cnoose, how they uae cor
