1. NEEDS AND GRATIFICATIONS

Five basic assumptions were erated Ina study of Kate, Blumer, and Gurevitch in 1974 as follows.
They provide a framework for understanding the correlation between media and audiences:

1. The audience is concelved as active, ie, am important part of of mass meclia use is
aisumed 10 be goal oriented ,.. patterns of media use are shaped by more or less
definie expectations of what cemain kinds of content have to offer the aucbence
member,

2. Inthe mass communication process mach initiacive in linking need gratification and
media choice lies with the audience member. This places a strong limitation on
theorizing about any form of straight-line effect of media coment on altitudes and
behavior.

3. The media compete with other sources of need satisfaction The needs served by
Tass COMMUNION coMstiuie but a segment of the wider range of human meeds,
amd the degre: to which they can be adequately met throagis mass media consump
tim certainly varies.

4. Methoedologically speaking, many of the goals of mass needa ast com be derived
from data supplied by individual audience members themselves- Le. pene
are sufficiently self-aware te be able to repert their interests and motives im
particular cases, or at least to recognize them when confronted with chem in an
imtellipihe and familiar verbal formubadion.

5. Value jadgments aboot the culniral significance of mass communication should be
suspended while audience onenialions are explored on their own terms. (p. 15-17.

in addition, Kui, Bhomber, and Gurevich also commented that, although previous researches om
gratifications detected diverse gratiGcations that attract people on the media, they did not address che
conmectoms benween these acatifications (Kace et al. 15%dal. They suggested that wees and gratidl-
cations research comeer with following aspects: “(1) the social and the psychological orggins of (2)
needs whieh genera (2) expectations of (4) the mass media or other sources which lead to (5) dit-
ferential exposure (or engaging in other activites), resuking in (6) need gratification and (7) other
Conepienoes, perhaps mostly unintended ones" (Katz et al, 19%26, p. 20). The studies of Kate and
his colleagees laid a theoretical foundation of bing the uses and gratiGcetions approach. Since
chon, the research om this subject hae ben strengthened and extended, The cucrent status of cess and
gratifications is still hace’ on Fate's Mies anadpels, particulacly as nie teedia Geme hive emerged in
