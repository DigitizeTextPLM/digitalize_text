1 Early Influences

The falkewing theorists significantly comtrihuned 10 the examina of uncertainty in communication,
The influence of their work can be seen reflected i the assumptions of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

11) Leon Festioger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied psychology et the University of lawa under the direction of Kurt Lewin, Lewin,

ore of the founders of social geychology and a pioneer im the research of growp dynamics, had a sub-
Haetial influence ont the developenent of imerpersonal communikation, After graduation, initially
worked af the Umivenaty of Rochester, bet in 1945 he followed Lewin to Massachusetts lecsti-
tute of Techmology and the Research Center for Groep Dynamics. After Lewin death, Festinger

worked at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the New School fir Social Research

(Semseleon, 2M}, Much of Pestinger's research followed his wemtor Lewin and further deweloped.

Lewin'’s theories, Several of Festinger theories were highly influential on the emerging foeld of m-

berpersonal communication arid on the development of URT, Fetinger is best lnown for the theories

of Cognitive Disanance and Social Comparison. Cognitive Dissonance theory (CDT) amemspoed to

explain how an imbalance among eegnitions might affect an individual. Lewin foreshadowed CDT

ie his observations regarding attitede change in etal groupe (Pesinger, 1942). COT allows for three

reblionships to occur among cognitions: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are in equi-

litcium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in Gonpetithon wath each

other, aad an imelevant relalionship, it weich the cognitions in question have no effect on one aneiher

(West & Turner, 20M. Cognitne Disseeance, like uncertainty, hes an element of arousal and dis-

comfirt that individuals seek to reduce, Social Comparison theory postulates that individuals look to

feedback from others to ewaluate their performance and abilities, To ewaluane the self, dhe individual

usually seeks he opines of others who are similar to the self. This need for sscial comparison can.
result in condoemity pressures (Trenholm a Jensen, 2004). Berger and Calabrese (1975) related so-
cial comparison to URT by stating that “Festinger has suggested that persons seek out sinwilar others
who are proximate when they experience a high kvel of wncertainty regarding Ghe appropriateness of
their behavior and/or opinions ina particular situation” (p. LOT). Pestinger received the Distinguished
Scientiat waar of the American Paycholegical Association and the Distinguished Senior Scsendtist
Award from the Soclety of Experimental Social Paychokgy. Featinger's legacy is significant, and
his thecretical infkerrce can sill be recognized in coniemporary social science research. Arcrstm (in
Festinger, 1980) stated, “Tt was in this era that Leos Pestieger lwented ond developed his theory of
cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, sacial paycholegy has not heen the same since” (p. 3p.
