1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language translation marked the first real appearance of the idea of the
culture indusiry oulside of 4 German comlest. In the years since there have Deen numer-
ous critica of the head, nol mast since Adama made sweeping generalizations about ‘he
commadified and fef#hized character of all cultural gooda" (Cook, 1996, p. 173). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adame erred in nat discussing the processes of Gul-
tural production, and failed 10 earning the cullure indieetry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing are achvertsing (Cock, 1995, p. 48).

For Tany Eagkaton, both Adoma and Marcuse overestimated the dominans Kdeology, be-
fieving that “capitalat acciety languishes in the grip of an al-pervasive reificalion’ (Eagleton,
1581. p, 44) Stil, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliefs
arierg oppressed peaples in sociely has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys-
tem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 26). Fredric Jamesan pointed out that Adomo's Kea
ofa culture indusiry was historically limited, since the eocety that developed in the 1960s
ane 15°05 with mew media went beyond the cultural possibilities avalable during te 1940s.
i iie ihe idea of the cukure mdusiry can be dedeanded as a useful theory for Peduetrial soci-
efies between 1920 and 1970, trying to use & loday weakens its effechveness (Hohendahil
1955, p. 146-48). Thus, fora some critics, the value of the idea of the culture industry wauid
aponar to be meneiy historical, if trey in fact conceded that @ had any value at all,

This for some critics moderniel works would be counteracting forced against the dominant
idegkegy As noted in ihe exarple of Orson Valles, however, it may be the case that the
dominant daclooy can co-opl modemist works for ts oan ends. The idea of the culture
industry has had an mpertance in efitical theory siroe its appearance in the 1900s, im that

ft has led to thought about ihe role of mass communications in relation to idealogy, and
hence, society. Sino Adama made seeeping generalizations about the impact of fhe culture
industry, aevd Sines he cid not systematically explore how the culture induatry operated, il hae
been generally easy for some to dismiss the idea of & cubure erdialry, Iti maneiheless the

A reexamination of the idea of the culture industry may be necessary lin order te theorize on
