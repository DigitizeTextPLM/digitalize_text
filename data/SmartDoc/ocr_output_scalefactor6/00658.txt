1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Leon Festinger studied paycholngy atthe University of lorem under the direction of Rest nig
one af the founders of soci! psychology and a ploneer in the research af group ESTES
cinntial infueace on the development of inkxperscmal communication. After gradmacions =

worked af the University of Rochester, but in 1945 ee followed Lewim to Massachusects Umsti-
tuce of Techmsolngy amd the Rewarch Center for Group Dynamics. ABer Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Stundord University, and the New School for Social Research
(Samelson, 2000), Much of Festinger’s research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin's theories. Several of Pestinger theories were highly influential on the emerging Feld of in-
lenpersonal communication and om the development of WRT. Festinger is best known for the theories
af Cognitive Dissomimce and Social Comparison, Cognitive Dissonance theory (COT) attempted ta
explain how an imbalance among: comnitions might aes at individaal. Lewin foreshadowed cor
in his observations regarding attilude change in small groups (Festinger, P82). COT allows for three
reblineships to occur among copnilis: a Gatisonanl relationship, im wich cognilioes ane in equi-
librium with each other; a dissonant relationship, im which cognitions are in competition with each
other; and an irrelevant relationshap, in which the cognations in question have ne eect on ote another
(West & Terner, 200). Cognitive [issonance, like uncertainty, has an element of arousal and dis-
comdort that individuals seek to redece. Social Comparison theory postulapes that individuals kook te
feedback from others be mvaheate ther perloomand: and abilities Te evaluate the self, the individaal
ually seeks the opinions of others who are similar to ihe self. This need for social comparison cae
result im conformity pressures (Trenholm & Jensen, 2004). Berger and Calabrese (1975) related so-
cial comparison to URT bw stating that “Festinger bas suggested thal persons seek out sienilar others
hes are provimaine when they experioace a high heel of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of
their behavior ander opinions in a particular stuation® ip. LOT). Festinger received the Distiaguished
Scientist award of the American Psycholwical Association and the Distinguished Senior Sclensist
Avrard from the Society of Experimental Sihozal Paychology. Fesiinger's kepacy is significant, and
his theoretical influence can still be recognized in Contemporary Social sclenoe research. Arongon Gm
Festinger, (960) stated, “Tt wee m this era thet Leon Fewinger invented ated developed his theory of
cognitive dissonance, and in my opinion, sockal paychology has not been the same since" ip. 3).
