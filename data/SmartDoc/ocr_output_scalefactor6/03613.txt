1, DEFINING UNCERTAINTY

Research conducted under the tle of interpersonal communication initially focused on persuesion,
social influence, and small grawp processes. Theorles explored the role of learning, dissanance, bal-
ance, social judgment, and reactance (Benger, 2005). Kurt Lewin, a forefather of social psychology,
played a considerable role in influencing interpersonal research pioneers such as Festinger, Heider,
Kelley, and Hovland, By the 1970s, research interests began to shift into the realm of social interaction,
relational developmem, ated relatkonal control. This was influenced by the research of such schovars

amd into the 19B0s, the cognitive approaches of Hewes, Planalp, Raloff, and Berger became popular
along, with research into behavioral and communicative adapéation by Giles, Burgoon, and Patterson.
Berger (2005) staves: “these early theoretical forays helped shape the interpersonal come research
agenda during the past beo decades" (p. 416). Today, interpersonal communication temds to focus
