Like many other structuralist scholars, Barthes was influenced by Saussure sinuctural linguishes.
To Saussure, he linguistic mechanem operates on bes levels, the syslematic system and the variation

Feeusing on thee systematic level, Sausume distingumhas tha language eyalam into bvo parts, the

The form is called tha signifier, which @ the extemal part of language. For example, both Ihe word
