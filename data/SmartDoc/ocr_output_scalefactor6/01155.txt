1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1872 English-language translation marked the frst real appearance of the idea of he
culture indusiry oulside of a German context. In the years since there have been numer
ous criticisms of tha bed, not least since Adame made sweeping generalizations about “the
commodified and fetishized character of all cultural gooda” (Cook, 1986, p. 173). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adana erred in nat discussing tie processes of Gul-
tural production, and failed 10 ewarine the cullure industry's economic dependence on ather
business sectors, including marketing and actvertsing (Cook, 1995, p. 48).

For Tary Eagkaton, both Adome and Marcuse overestimated the dominant deology, be-
leving that “captalet acciety languishes in the grip of an al-pervasive reification’ (Eagleton,
1581. p, 44) Stil, Eagleton conceded that “the diffusion of dominant values and beliele
among oppressed peaples in sociely has some part to play in the reproduction of the sys-
tem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36). Fredric Jameson pointed out thal Ademo's Kea
ofa culture indusirys wae historically iimited, since the society that developed in the 1860s
and 1970s with mew media went beyond the cultural possibilities avaiable during the 1340s.
