cus crkiceens of Ihe text, not least sinos Adorno made sweeping generalizations aout “the
commedified and fetishized character of all cultural goods” (Cook, 1906, p. 173). For the
generally sympathetic Oeborah Cook, Adorno erred in not gacussing the processes of cul-
lural production, and failed to examine the culture industry's economic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertising (Cook, 1996,p. 48).
