1 Critical Response to “The Culture Industry”

The 1972 English-language trarstation marked the first real appearance of the ide of fe
culture industry auiside of a German context. in the years since thera hawe bean numer-
ous criticisms of the text, nat least since Ademo made sweeping generalizations about the
commediied and fetishized character of all culbural goods" (Cook, 1866. p. 173). For the
generally sympathetic Deborah Cook, Adoeno ened in not dacussing he processes of cul:
ural production, and tailed to @xamine ihe culture industry's eooreenic dependence on other
business sectors, including marketing and advertsing (Cook, 1235, p. 46).

For Terry Eagleton, both Adomo and Marcuse overestimated the dominant ideology, Be
lieving that “capitalist society languishes in the grip of an all-pervasive reification” (Eagleton,
1991, p. 46). Stl, Eagleton comoaded that “the diffugion of daminant walues ei
amang copressed peoples in society has some parl to play in the reproduction of the sys-
tem as a whole” (Eagleton, 1991, p. 36). Frecine Jameson groieted out that Aderras bebe

and 1870s ath new media went beyond the cuRural possibilities available curing the 1940s.
While the idea of the culture industry Gan be defended as a useful iheary for indugirial soc.
elies between 1920 and 1970, trying bo use it today weakens Ils effectiveness (Hohandahl
