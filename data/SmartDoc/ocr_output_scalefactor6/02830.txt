In addition, Katz, Blumer, and Gurevitch also commested that, although previous researches om
gratifications detected diverse gratificatlons that attract people on the media, they did not address the
enmmections between these gralificetions (Katz at al., 1974). They suppested that ses and gratiti-
callons research concen with following aspect: “(1) the seclal and the psychological origins of (2)
nex which generate (3) expeciainons of (4) the mass media or other sores which bead bo (3) dif-
ferential exposure {or engaging In other activicies), resulting in (6) need gratification and (7) other
COMmeqaences, perhape mostly unintented oes” (Rete al, 1974b, p, 20). The shies of Kate and
is colleagues laid a theoretical foundation of building the uses and gratifscations approach, Since
thes, the research on chs subject has been srengtheaed and extended, The current stabos of uses and
Bratifecations is still based on Kates firet analysts, particularly as new ooedla forms have emerged in

such an electronic information age when people have more options of media use.
