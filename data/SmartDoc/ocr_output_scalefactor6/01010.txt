1.1. Introduction

Uses and gratificaliona approach & an mfuential tradition in pedia research, The original
conception of he apgroach was based on the research for explaining the great appeal of
certain media contents. The core quedtion of such research is: Why do people use media
and what dothey use tham for? (Michal, 1963}. There exists @ basic idea in tls approach.
audience members know media coment, and which media they can use to meal thei needs.
In the mass communication process, uses and gratifications approach puts the function of
inking need gratficalions and media choice claarly on the side of audience members. It
auggests that peaple's needs influence whal media they wauld choose, how they ube Ger-
tain media and what gratifications the media give them, The approach difters from other
theoretical perspectives in thal it regards audiences a8 active media users a6 opposed to
passive receivers of information. lin contrast te traditional media ettects theares which 1ocurs
on “what media do to people” and assume audiences are homogenous, uses and gralifica-
lions approach is mare concemed with “ahal poopie do with media” (Katz, 1589). A allows
audiences personal needa to use media and reaponds to Ihe media, which determined by
their social and paychological background. Uses and gratifcations approach also postulates
that the media compate with athe: information saurces far audience's need salistachon (Katz
ef al. 7974a). As traditional mass media and new media continue to prowde people with 4
wide range of media plaiformé and coriant, it is considered one of The most appropriate
perepactives for investigating why auckences choose fo be exposed io different
The approach emphasizes audiences’ choice by asseasing thelr reasons for using
a@certain media to the disregard of ofhers, ag well ae the various gratnications obtained
from the media, based on individual social and psycholagical requirements (Severin
& Tankard, 1997). 4s a broader perspective among communication researches, if pro-
vides a framework for widerstanding the processes by which media participants seah
information a content selectively, commensurate with ther needs and interests (Katz
otal, 197#a), Audience members then incorporate the content to fulfill their needs or
fo satiety their interests (Lowery & Mabila, 1953).
