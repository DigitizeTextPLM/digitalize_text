1 Early Influences

The fallowing theorists significantly contributed to the examination of uncertainty in ¢onamunication.
The influence of ther work can be seen reflected im the assumptkins of Berger and Calabrese (1975).

1.1 Leon Festinger (1919-1989)

Loon Festinger stadied pewchology atthe University of Lowa under thedirection of Kurt Lewin. Lewin,
ome of the founders of social peychology and «pioneer in the research of group dynamics, had a sub-
dantial influence om the dewelapment of interpersonal communication. After graduation, initially
worked at the University of Rochester, hut im 1945 be followed Lewin bo Masiachusetts Insti-
tute of Techmology anil the Research Center for Group Dynamics. After Lewin death, Festinger
worked at the University of Michigan, Statfond University, and the New School for Social Research
(Somelson, SO), Much of Pestinger's research followed his mentor Lewin and further developed
Lewin's theories. Several of Feetinger theories were highly infhoential on the emerging field of in
tepersonal communication and on the development of LART. Festinger ts best knonen for the theories
of Cognitive Dissonance asd Social Comparison. Cognilive Dissmeince theory (CDT) attempted to
explain how an imbalance among comeitins might affect an individual, Lewin foreshadowed COT
in hig. ohservatlons regarding attitude charge in antall groups (Festinger. (982) COT allowa for three
rellionships to G0cur among copntion:: a consonant relationship, in which cognitions are im equi-
librium with each other; a dissonant relationship, in which cognitions are in competitiom with each
other, and an imelevant relationship, in which the cognitions in question have no effect om one another
(West & Temner, 2000). Cognitive Dissonance. like meertainty, has an element of arousal and dés-
comfort that individuals seek to reduce. Social Comparison thecry populates thet individuals look 10
feedback Grom others w evalumce their performance and abilities. To evaluate the self. the individiial
uewailly sacks dhe opimions of others who are similar to the self. This need for social comparison can
result in cemformity pressures (Trenholm & Jeneext, 2004). Berger ond Calabrese (1975) related so-
cial comparison to WRT by strting thet “Festinger his suggested thet persons seek out similar others
whi are proximate when they expericece a high kevel of uncertainty regarding the appropriateness of
ther behavior andor asinions ina particular situation” [p, 107) Festinger received the Distinguished
Selemtist award of the Amerikan Peychologecal Association anid the Distingeithed Scmior Scientist
Agwond from the Society of Experimental Social Peychology. Pestinger's legacy is significant, and
his iheoretical influence Gan alll be recognized in comtemporary seial soence research. Aronson (in
Festinger, [98 slated, “It wes in this era that Loon Festinger inverted and developed his theory of
copaitive deaonance, amd in ey opinion, ool! peychology has mot been the same sie” fp, 45.
