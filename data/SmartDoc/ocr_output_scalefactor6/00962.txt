than anything ese that distinguishes mocks public relations fram old-time hit or miss publicity and
propaganda (Bernaye, UR, p22). Forthermore, Bernig theories also represeait 4 different view of

the formation of public opinion. In oppeeition to Lippmann, who views the public os being easily
manipolated, Bernayd cations against this. He claims, The pubis ie not an amore mass which
enn be molded at will or dictated to (Bermaye, 1928, p. 60). Instesd, Bernays (1938) offers the ides.
that in athemptitg, to influence the public, a buskness must atiwndy what terms the partnership can be

made atobeable and mutually bamefbelal. It must explain ibself, ite aims, its objectives, ta the

Barnays claborates on thee ikea in Public Reletices (1052). Thather than merely attempting to
manipulate the poblic through propaganda, Bernays presenta public relations as a tool that cam be
used to combine the ees of the poblic and the persuader. The ohjective-minded pablic ralations

society, but still deo clam that manipulation of the public is possible, Aeenaya (1052) writes of the
